# Analysis of FightAging.org Content (2004-2025)

## Introduction

As someone passionate about entering the anti-aging research field and honing my machine learning skills, I created this project to pursue both goals simultaneously.

Please bear in mind that I am currently no expert in this field; I created this project mainly to orient myself, but I still believe it is worth sharing. Therefore, is worth noting that the analysis may contain imprecisions or areas for improvement.

I chose to analyze the rich content from FightAging.org, one of my favorite resources on the subject, made available under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license.

While I'm still developing my expertise, I hope this data-driven exploration of longevity topics proves interesting and useful. The analysis is presented in four parts, starting with a foundational topic review using traditional text analysis methods.
