Producing the rejuvenation therapies of tomorrow is a project that will last for decades: the researchers who will lead companies and academic laboratories into the final stretches to produce the first comprehensive rejuvenation toolkit are still undergraduates and postgraduates today, just starting their careers. It is a very exciting time to be in biotechnology. It is of great importance that today's leaders in the field of aging research do better than their predecessors when it comes to presenting their field as the groundbreaking, revolutionary, exciting place that it will be over the next twenty years. The world is changing, biotechnology is advancing at a breakneck pace, and the medicine of ten or twenty years from now will look like science fiction already. Radical new possibilities are on the horizon, and doors are opening. Today's scientists must cultivate a next generation of researchers who see aging as the most important medical condition yet be treated in earnest, and who find the new tools for producing those future treatments to be exciting: worth devoting a career to. Hence advocacy and progress isn't just about getting the job done today and raising the funds for today's researchers, but it is also about creating the research community of tomorrow. A series of posts at the SENS Research Foundation profiles this year's summer scholars and the work they are carrying out relevant to aging and rejuvenation: 2014 SRF Summer Scholar Profile: Christine Wu At the SENS Research Foundation, I work in the OncoSENS department with Dr. Haroldo Silva. My project will study a specific pathway used by cancer cells called the Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) pathway with the use of the ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (APB) assay. I will be performing Dr. Silva's version of the APB assay on two specific cell lines: an ALT cell line, called U2OS, and a telomerase control cell line, called 143B. I will be treating each of these cell lines with four drugs provided to us by Dr. Robert J. Shmookler Reis of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, which are all known inhibitors of different proteins in homologous recombination -mediated pathways. My project will assess the effect of these drugs on the ALT pathway. The results generated by the APB assay will provide new data to better assess the potential of these drugs for cancer therapy, particularly for tumors associated with the ALT mechanism. 2014 SRF Summer Scholar Profile: Joi McLaughlin This summer, at the Buck Institute For Research on Aging , I will be working on a project in the laboratory of Dr. Heinrich Jasper. I will be examining the effect of unfolded proteins in fruit fly mitochondria on stem cell maintenance. Previous studies have shown that fruit fly gut stem cells tend to divide and generate new cells more frequently in stressful environments. Coincidently, the stress of numerous unfolded proteins in the mitochondrion triggers the mitochondrial unfolded protein response . Recently, the response to mitochondrial unfolded proteins has been shown to control the aging rate of various organisms and has been associated with many renowned aging modulators. We also know that activating the response in certain body parts can have global effects, and these effects could greatly impact the aging process. Yet, there remains uncertainty regarding which proteins initiate the active pathway that alters aging, as opposed to those that are just associated with the process, and also the exact difference between mitochondrial unfolded protein response and other stress responses that seem to have no influence on aging. Thus, this project aims to provide some clarity concerning these aspects of the response. 2014 SRF Summer Scholar Profile: Megan Harper Cellular senescence is a state of irreversible growth arrest that serves to protect against cancer. Senescent cells are accumulated with age or induced by anti-cancer therapies, such as chemotherapy and irradiation , in the tissue microenvironment. Senescent cells experience deep morphological and functional changes, and they activate a secretory program known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) . The SASP includes several pro-inflammatory factors for which levels are increased during aging and cancer treatment. The secretory program is regulated by multiple molecular events. Among those, the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1a has been linked to many pathways and factors involved during senescence. HIF-1a responds to oxygen levels to promote the formation of new blood vessels in hypoxic conditions. During my internship, I will address the following questions: 1) Which chemotherapy drug or irradiation dose currently used for treatment of cancer patients induces senescence in the tissue microenvironment? and 2) How does the phenotype of senescent cells respond to HIF-1a regulation and to different oxygen concentrations? 2014 SRF Summer Scholar Profile: Haben Tesfamariam This summer I will be working with Dr. Mark McCormick in the laboratory of Dr. Brian Kennedy at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging. We are working in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans . These model organisms live for only a few weeks, making it possible to quickly study changes in their lifespan. Because they have long been used to study many other biological processes, there are many existing tools available to us when working with these organisms, such as genome-wide deletion collections. Finally, it has been shown repeatedly in many diverse biological processes that fundamental mechanisms first uncovered in simple model organisms are often conserved in higher organisms, such as humans. In the case of aging, changes in yeast genes in the TOR (target of rapamycin) signaling pathway , including the yeast gene TOR1 itself, were shown to extend lifespan, and subsequent work has shown that treatment with the TOR targeting drug rapamycin extends lifespan when fed to middle-aged mice, leading us to hypothesize that this drug target or others we uncover may allow us to extend human lifespan as well. 2014 SRF Summer Scholar Profile: Ethan Bassin Recent progress in whole organ engineering techniques based on decellularization of organs and recellularization of the resulting collagen-based matrix suggests that this method could eventually be used in transplantation. The Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine team has developed a combination cell seeding system for efficient and functional re-endothelialization of the entire vasculature of an acellular renal scaffold. In their previous study, the team developed a surface modification method to reinforce endothelial cell attachment onto renal vasculature via CD31 antibody conjugation . CD31 antibody binds to an antigen found on endothelial cells. Encouraged by their promising results using an endothelial cell line, the WFIRM team has recently attempted to re-endothelialize the kidney scaffolds using autologous cell sources for long-term porcine kidney implantation. This approach could potentially be applied to a translational clinical trial. For my project, I plan to isolate and characterize primary endothelial cells from pigs to determine if the conjugation of CD31 antibody on vasculatures of kidney scaffolds will enhance primary endothelial cell attachment. 2014 SRF Summer Scholar Profile: Shruti Singh This summer, I am working on a thymus regeneration project in Dr. John Jackson's lab at the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine. The thymus is a specialized organ in the immune system, and it is involved in the maturation of T-cells . T-cells recognize and attack foreign substances, called antigens, thus protecting the body from developing infections. In old age, the thymus starts to lose its functional abilities, rendering the immune system ineffective. One approach to restore the immune system in aged individuals is the regeneration of the thymus. Thymic tissue regeneration and T-cell maturation also have application in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, immunodeficiencies, and transplant rejection. During the summer, I will work on one part of this larger project. I plan to decellularize a small piece of pig thymus, which entails getting rid of all the cells in the thymus, leaving behind the extracellular structure called a scaffold. After decellularizing the thymus, I will reseed the thymus scaffold with thymus epithelial cells and bone marrow cells from mice, providing a 3-D environment to the cells that resembles their natural environment in the body. I will then analyze the proliferation of these cells in the scaffold and look for the production of mature T-cells. The success of this project will be an important step forward towards the overarching goal of whole thymus regeneration.\", 'start_index': 845, 'title': 'Summer Scholars at the SENS Research Foundation'}, page_content=\"is changing, biotechnology is advancing at a breakneck pace, and the medicine of ten or twenty years from now will look like science fiction already.

All too much of the field of translational aging research is focused on finding ways to produce small benefits , such as via the use of repurposed existing supplements. This may produce gains for investors, but it won't meaningfully change the present shape of a human life. We need to do better than that. Fortunately, there are a small number of non-profit organizations and academic groups focused on development of the means of rejuvenation, rather than on means of modestly slowing aging. Two of the best are the SENS Research Foundation and LEV Foundation , both informed by the Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS) , a list of important contributing causes of aging, the cell and tissue damage that causes dysfunction, alongside proposed forms of therapy to repair that damage. Both of these non-profit organizations are presently running year end fundraisers to support their ongoing research programs, covering important areas of aging and rejuvenation that are not receiving sufficient attention elsewhere in the research community, or that are slowed by challenges in the fundamental science, or that are neglected by researchers due to a lack of tooling or a foundation to proceed. I consider both the SENS Research Foundation and LEV Foundation to be worthy recipients for your charitable donations.

Funding makes the world turn; progress in building the foundations for rejuvenation therapies depends upon those funds. SENS Research Foundation: Welcome to our 2023 End of Year Campaign SENS Research Foundation (SRF) has spent the past year diligently employing your generous contributions towards accelerating the development of therapies to prevent, treat, and cure the diseases of aging. Just this year we've spoken at longevity conferences, highlighted our work with US policy makers and global leaders in health, submitted patents and publications on our research, educated dozens of students, supported translational therapies in their journey to market, and so much more. This End of Year Campaign focuses on SRF and the relationships we have built over the last couple years. These collaborations grow the effectiveness of our community and industry, extending our reach and deepening our impact to target directly the diseases and disabilities of aging. Every week we highlight a new organization and the real-world impact they are making to turn our mission into reality. LEV Foundation: 2023 End-of-Year Fundraiser LEV Foundation's story has just begun. In 2024, with your support, we're planning to: (a) Initiate the second study in the Robust Mouse Rejuvenation program. Building on the success of the ongoing first experiment, RMR-2 will shed light on the interactions between a new panel of therapies. (b) Bring the Dublin Longevity Declaration's message of hope to a global audience, through a major media campaign including translations into most widely-spoken languages. We'll recruit more renowned signatories - and even more importantly, build on the foundation the Declaration has provided to engage with policymakers and leaders around the world, seeking concrete action on its fundamental recommendation: to immediately expand research on extending healthy human lifespans. (c) Organize and support the next Longevity Summit Dublin , scheduled to take place on June 13-16, 2024. Speakers will be announced over the coming months, but we're already very confident that the third edition of the Summit will be just as unmissable as the first two events. (d) Continue enabling our partners at the Healthspan Action Coalition , Alliance for Longevity Initiatives (A4LI) , and AfroLongevity , to build stronger connections with established public- and private-sector organizations, enhancing awareness of the potential of longevity research amongst those who set priorities for healthcare and research funding at all levels. A4LI's goals for the coming year include establishing an annual legislative briefing for longevity science in the US House of Representatives, and promoting passage of the Advanced Approval Pathway for Longevity Medicines .\", 'publish_date': '2023-11-20'}, page_content=\"trying to make that future a reality!

We did it to transform the way you think about medicine. We knew it was a big agenda when we set out, and we were fully conscious of how small a public charity we were. We recognized that our first successful steps would depend upon our demonstration of fundamental credibility to the medical science community. That is why I am especially pleased to present this 2010 end of year report.

That more or less encompasses these questions: what exactly causes aging, and what can be done here and now to make progress towards preventing it and reversing it? For example, here\\'s an excerpt from the GlycoSENS category , research with the potential to reverse the cause of much of the chemical and structural aging of skin, blood vessel walls, and many forms of connective tissue: The elasticity of the artery wall , the flexibility of the lens of the eye, and the high tensile strength of the ligaments are examples of tissues that rely on maintaining their proper structure. But chemical reactions with other molecules in the extracellular space occasionally result in a chemical bond (a so-called crosslink ) between two nearby proteins that were previously free-moving, impairing their ability to slide across or along each other and thereby impairing function. It is the goal of this project to identify chemicals that can react with these crosslinks and break them without reacting with anything that we don\\'t want to break. ... In 2011, we established a Center of Excellence for GlycoSENS and other rejuvenation research at Cambridge University and hired postdoctoral student Rhian Grainger to design and perform experiments to develop reagents that can detect proteins bearing glucosepane crosslinks, facilitating further studies on its structure, abundance, and cleavage by small molecules. We also established a collaboration with researchers at Yale University, who will lend their expertise in generating advanced glycation end-products and lead efforts in developing agents which may be able to cleave glucosepane.

A researcher in the field of aging could find two or more scientific events every month to attend, and the business side of conference hosting is catching up. I had to give up noting every event of interest a number of years ago for the sake of space, and I know of at least one individual who provides a service to the community by maintaining what is becoming quite a lengthy calendar of conferences. That there are more conferences rather than fewer conferences is a sign of health for the field . When people hold conferences, they do so because there is a sizable scientific or professional organization with the funds to spare, or because a for-profit conference host sees an opportunity to make a profit by providing a conference series as a service to the community. As a rough metric of growth, it is helpful. A field with twenty conferences in a year is better funded and moving more rapidly than one with two. Today I\\'ll point out a small selection of reports that cover conferences held earlier this year. While looking through these, consider that next year will start off much the same way. There is a good selection of longevity-related conferences and meetings early next year: Longevity Therapeutics , a number of other investor-focused events running alongside the big JP Morgan healthcare conference in San Francisco, the Longevity Leaders event in London, and of course Undoing Aging 2019 in Berlin at the end of the first quarter. A Summary of the 5th Annual Aging and Drug Discovery Forum 2018 \"Why do we age?\"; \"Can we intervene in the aging process?\"; and if so, what approaches should aging science take to transform research into viable therapeutic interventions to improve public health? Understanding the mechanisms of aging will be of vital importance to answering these questions. However, several obstacles stand in the way of generating efficacious and safe interventions that extend the period of healthy life. At the 5th Annual Aging and Drug Discovery Forum which was held during the Basel Life Congress , Basel, Switzerland, September 12-13, 2018, leading aging experts from academia and industry came together to discuss top issues in aging research. Here, we provide a brief overview of the presented results and discussion points. A Report from the 2018 International Society on Aging and Disease Conference The International Society on Aging and Disease (ISOAD) recently held its third international conference in Nice, France, bringing together researchers - and longevity activists - from around the world. Prof. Gilson founded the Ircan Institute for Research on Cancer and Aging in Nice in 2012. \"It was perhaps the first institute that specifically aimed to couple the themes of aging and cancer in the same laboratory, even if the links between them had been known to some extent. That was its originality. We\\'ve laid the foundations - to have the expertise, the right people, the right models - and I think we\\'re going to have important answers for the role of telomeres in aging and, more generally, cellular senescence , which is the favorite current target of a lot of pharmaceutical or fundamental research that we are revisiting via our original models.\" Thoughts on the 2018 Eurosymposium on Healthy Ageing When I first learned about the possibility of achieving human rejuvenation through biotechnological means , little did I know that this would lead me to meet many of the central figures in the field during a conference some seven years later - let alone that I would be speaking at the very same event. Yet, I\\'ve had the privilege to attend the Fourth Eurosymposium on Healthy Ageing (EHA) held in Brussels on November 8-10, an experience that gave me a feel of just how real the prospect of human rejuvenation is. The first day of the conference was basically a journey into the world of cellular senescence: methods of targeting senescent cells , the SASP , drug delivery systems, and so forth; however, other topics, such as the extracellular matrix , transcriptomics , and stem cells , were also discussed. A great deal more researchers and other people otherwise involved in the community were present on the first morning than there were at the pre-conference meeting; the peak was probably during the second day, which saw a wider variety of topics, including genomics , DNA repair , bioinformatics , and the first panel of the conference.'}, page_content='cellular senescence: methods of targeting senescent cells , the SASP , drug delivery systems, and so forth; however, other topics, such as the extracellular matrix , transcriptomics , and stem cells , were also discussed.

Become a SENS Patron to support the SENS Research Foundation with regular donations, or join the Methuselah 300 to do the same for the Methuselah Foundation programs. Thanks to the efforts of the past twenty years, the first rejuvenation therapies are accepted and on their way to the clinic. No longer must we argue over the plausibility of turning back aging; now we only argue over how best to go about it. As it happens, the best way forward in the matter of treating aging as a medical condition, a condition that can be controlled and minimized, is outlined by the SENS rejuvenation research programs . It involves building new therapies that can repair the well-known and well-cataloged forms of cell and tissue damage that lie at the root of aging. Yet even as easy as it is to make charitable donations to support this work, most of the SENS agenda is still poorly funded and little worked on when compared with the mainstream of medicine, in which tens of thousands of scientists and physicians engage in heroic, futile efforts to stave off aging, failing because they are not focused on repairing its causes. The consistent failures of the past have led to a culture in which failure is expected - but this is only the result of a bad choice of strategy. It can be changed. The first rejuvenation therapies, involving senolytic drugs to selectively destroy senescent cells , are a going concern, but we are far from where we should be when it comes to the rest of the rejuvenation biotechnology toolkit.

If one wanted to take in all of the presentations and take notes, as I\\'ve done in the past , ARDD would be much more of a test of endurance than other longevity industry conferences. It is five 12 hour days, starting with networking at 8am, the last presentations going on past 8pm, and then socializing at nearby bars afterwards for the truly dedicated. This on top of jet lag for those coming in from the US in direction and Asia in the other. The intent of the organizers is for participants, and those following the livestream, to drop in for the topics that interest them, and take the time for other activities in between. The mix of attendees was, as always, some combination of academics, the founders of biotech startups, visitors from Big Pharma, and investors, those being a mix of interested individuals and venture capitalists. Judging from discussions held in the corridors, the present view of the investment market for biotech startups is that while some people are raising funds with apparent ease, it is still not a great environment. Better than the start of the year, but not great. There were fewer institutional investors at ARDD than in past years, and the consensus appears to be to expect fiscal gloom until later in 2024. Expenditures are cut, timelines extended, and bridge rounds are raised, business as usual for lean times. The Big Pharma interest in the conference varied from \"to be honest, my boss told me an hour ago to come in and represent the company, I\\'m really not familiar with this,\" to department heads with interesting experience and well-considered positions on the field. As some of you may know, one of my areas of interest is the path to better gene therapies , and I had a lengthy conversation with the director of a gene therapy program in which our views aligned on many of the details. Viral vectors are going to be amazing in 2050, but are very much not amazing now; there would be a mass exodus from the development of mRNA therapies if only someone could find a way to deliver plasmids to the nucleus ; the development of tissue-targeted delivery systems seems on the verge of becoming impressive , but still has a long way to go if your targets are small areas of the body; and so forth. This year, I confess, I attended only a fraction of the many presentations in the program . Most of my time was taken up with networking. For those who didn\\'t attend, I recommend looking through the program and waiting for the videos to be posted. There were some interesting talks. The role and details of cellular senescence in aging was a frequent topic. Both the academic and industry communities are rapidly digging in to the biochemistry of senescence, with new discoveries emerging and the debates shifting on a regular basis. The Deciduous Therapeutics program is becoming one of the most interesting in the industry, given that their approach to rousing the immune system to destroy senescent cells lasts for a considerable time following a single dose. At the same time, they are far enough along in their work that the supply of new details shared in public is drying up, as often happens. We at Repair Biotechnologies shared that our LNP -mRNA therapy can rapidly reverse both atherosclerosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in animal models . We plan to submit our first pre-IND package later in the year. Maxwell Biosciences is making an appearance at most conferences these days as they ramp up their program; they produce a small molecule mimetic of the LL-37 antimicrobial peptide, a sort of too-good-to-be-true part of the innate immune system that improves just about every process the immune system touches when upregulated. It attacks bacteria, viruses, cancers, and even appears to improve aspects of tissue maintenance. Their program is focused on delivery as needed. It did occur to me that one could learn from the Minicircle approach to follistatin upregulation and use some form of long-lasting vector to turn a small volume of subcutaneous fat cells into a factory for LL-37, permanently upregulating it and its effects on immune defenses, but apparently this doesn\\'t have the desired effect - hence the need for a mimetic rather than the original peptide. Other fellow travelers on the conference circuit showing off their progress included some of the growing number of reprogramming ventures: Retro Biosciences , rapidly expanding their research footprint and likely to become a behemoth in the industry the next time they go out to seek investment; Life Biosciences , about which much the same might be said; the actual behemoth of Altos Labs ; and smaller ventures such as Turn Bio . Epigenetic reprogramming to reset the biochemistry of aged cells is, as one might expect, another frequent topic at conferences these days. Arguably the majority of funding for research and development in the field of longevity is currently focused on forms of partial reprogramming , which at least offers the hope that a decade from now we\\'ll have answers to all of the most important questions about this approach. We do live in a barnstorming age for biotechnology, and so very much more can be accomplished than regulators would approve for widespread use. There are a lot of high-flying technical discussions going on behind the scenes. Anything that starts with \"why can\\'t we just...\" usually ends with \"well, we could, but it would be very hard to obtain approval.\" Passing through the regulatory process is, meanwhile, so very expensive than only the most conservative, safe, incremental programs have an easy road to finding the necessary funding. Biotech investors are, if anything, even more conservative than the regulators, very ready to anticipate difficulties and avoid investing in those programs.

The reality of it is under there somewhere, but no professional journalist has either the time or the motivation to find it. This collection of articles from the MIT Technology Review (and those of us who have been around for a while will appreciate the irony of this particular publication grappling with the topic of treating aging as a medical condition) is fairly typical for the popular science media. It is a disconnected tour of some of the high points that will provide little anchoring context or understanding for those who are unfamiliar with the field. There is the sense that something is underway, yes, but the details are floating disconnected and the true shape of the whole is not conveyed. What is the true shape of the whole? There is major change and progress ahead, the research community is moving towards literal rejuvenation of the old , and the advent of senolytic drugs to selectively remove harmful senescent cells from old tissues has woken up the scientific and development establishments to the potential to effectively treat aging. Yet near all of the higher profile researchers and other folk are largely working on approaches that are really not that exciting, not capable of producing rejuvenation, and will have only small effects in the grand scheme of what is possible. But because of the general sense of potential in the field, those approaches will be funded, promoted, and widely discussed, simply because they are interventions aimed at aging. It will be quite challenging for a time to sort out the wheat from the chaff. What if aging weren\\'t inevitable, but a curable disease? A growing number of scientists are questioning our basic conception of aging. What if you could challenge your death - or even prevent it altogether? What if the panoply of diseases that strike us in old age are symptoms, not causes? What would change if we classified aging itself as the disease? David Sinclair , a geneticist at Harvard Medical School, is one of those on the front line of this movement. Medicine, he argues, should view aging not as a natural consequence of growing older, but as a condition in and of itself. Old age, in his view, is simply a pathology - and, like all pathologies, can be successfully treated. If we labeled aging differently, it would give us a far greater ability to tackle it in itself, rather than just treating the diseases that accompany it. It is a subtle shift, but one with big implications. How disease is classified and viewed by public health groups such as the World Health Organization (WHO) helps set priorities for governments and those who control funds. Regulators, including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) , have strict rules that guide what conditions a drug can be licensed to act on, and so what conditions it can be prescribed and sold for. Today aging isn\\'t on the list. Sinclair says it should be, because otherwise the massive investment needed to find ways to fend it off won\\'t appear. Has this scientist finally found the fountain of youth? Reprogramming is a way to reset the body\\'s so-called epigenetic marks : chemical switches in a cell that determine which of its genes are turned on and which are off. Erase these marks and a cell can forget if it was ever a skin or a bone cell, and revert to a much more primitive, embryonic state. The technique is frequently used by laboratories to manufacture stem cells . But Izpisúa Belmonte is in a vanguard of scientists who want to apply reprogramming to whole animals and, if they can control it precisely, to human bodies. Izpisúa Belmonte believes epigenetic reprogramming may prove to be an \"elixir of life\" that will extend human life span significantly. The transhumanists who want to live forever James Clement , 63, is a spry man with a shaved head and clear eyes, who spends his days gulping vitamins and trying to figure out how to make people live longer, including himself, his parents, and even me. From a home and several outbuildings in Gainesville, Florida, Clement runs BetterHumans , which he calls the world\\'s \"first transhumanist research organization.\" With funds from wealthy elderly men he knows, he is independently exploring drugs known to extend the healthy life span of rodents. Using a calculator, he extrapolates what a suitable human dose might be, and then finds people who will take them. Who wouldn\\'t want to reach 110, if not 500? Unlike mere armchair futurists, the life extensionists are prepared to experiment on themselves , and others, using vitamins and prescription cancer drugs, as well as compounds available only by finagling them from chemical suppliers. Lately the idea of living longer, maybe a lot longer, seems more realistic. As biologists uncover the fundamental facts of life, even ivory-tower academics now claim they know what the molecular \"hallmarks\" of aging are. In their lab animals, at least - roundworms and white mice - they can regularly increase life spans by 20% or 30% and sometimes more. Given these clues, Clement has financed and supervised four small studies, in volunteers, of treatments found to extend the healthy lives of rodents - the immune drug rapamycin , supplements that increase NAD+ levels, a combination of compounds that kill off senescent cells, and injections of plasma concentrated from umbilical cords . His aim is \"to do as many small trials as possible\" to generate and publish basic information on safety and possible benefits. With that, he says, people interested in life extension \"can decide to take the risk.\"'}, page_content='to find it.

And what I mean by decisive is the same sort of medical control that we have over most infectious diseases today. ... De Grey sees a time when people will go to their doctors for regular \\'maintenance,\\' which by then will include gene therapies , stem cell therapies, immune stimulation and a range of other advanced medical techniques to keep them in good shape. ... The idea is to engage in what you might call preventative geriatrics, where you go in to periodically repair that molecular and cellular damage before it gets to the level of abundance that is pathogenic. ... For some, the prospect of living for hundreds of years is not particularly attractive, either, as it conjures up an image of generations of sick, weak old people and societies increasingly less able to cope. But de Grey says that\\'s not what he\\'s working for. Keeping the killer diseases of old age at bay is the primary focus. ... This is absolutely not a matter of keeping people alive in a bad state of health. This is about preventing people from getting sick as a result of old age. The particular therapies that we are working on will only deliver long life as a side effect of delivering better health.\" Link: http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/04/us-ageing-cure-idUSTRE7632ID20110704 July 1st, 2011 Two Months Left Until the SENS5 Conference Permalink (With Comments) Permalink (No Comments) Posted by Reason No Comments Yet Add a Comment The fifth Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS) Conference, SENS5 , draws closer. It will be held from 31st August to 4th September at Queens\\' College in Cambridge - so there\\'s still time to register . The purpose of the SENS conference series, like all the SENS initiatives (such as the journal Rejuvenation Research ), is to expedite the development of truly effective therapies to postpone and treat human aging by tackling it as an engineering problem: not seeking elusive and probably illusory magic bullets, but instead enumerating the accumulating molecular and cellular changes that eventually kill us and identifying ways to repair - to reverse - those changes, rather than merely to slow down their further accumulation. This broadly defined regenerative medicine - which includes the repair of living cells and extracellular material in situ - applied to damage of aging, is what we refer to as rejuvenation biotechnologies . The program of presentations links to a range of interesting abstracts describing some of the important work that has taken place in the couple of years since SENS4, such as: Tissue engineering of the liver using decellularised scaffolds Here, we describe the fabrication of three-dimensional, naturally derived scaffolds with an intact vascular tree. ... The vascular network was used to reseed the scaffolds with human fetal liver and endothelial cells. These cells engrafted in their putative native locations within the decellularized organ and displayed typical endothelial, hepatic and biliary epithelial markers, thus creating a liver-like tissue in vitro . MitoSENS: Allotopic expression of mitochondrial genes using a co-translational import strategy The mitochondrion contains its own genome and encodes 13 proteins that are essential for the respiratory chain to function properly, [but] somatic mutations also accumulate in the mitochondria with normal aging. ... Thus far, we have stably transfected 5 of the 13 mitochondrial genes into the nuclear genome of human cell lines and are characterizing the expression and function of these exogenously expressed genes. I also note that the group in Florida who are running a trial of granulocyte transplant therapy for cancer - based on the impressive results achieved by Zheng Cui - will also be presenting. On the whole, the program is well worth browsing. If you are interested in this field of science and biotechnology and you are not yet signed up for the conference, you should give some thought to attending. July 1st, 2011 A Novel View of Stem Cell Decline Permalink (With Comments) Permalink (No Comments) Posted by Reason No Comments Yet Add a Comment An open access paper: \"One of the most important and complex diseases of modern society is metabolic syndrome . This syndrome has not been completely understood, and therefore an effective treatment is not available yet. We propose a possible stem cell mechanism involved in the development of metabolic syndrome. This way of thinking lets us consider also other significant pathologies that could have similar [or shared biological pathways], like lipodystrophic syndromes , progeria , and aging. All these clinical situations could be the consequence of a progressive and persistent stem cell exhaustion syndrome (SCES). The main outcome of this SCES would be an irreversible loss of the effective regenerative mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) pools. In this way, the normal repairing capacities of the organism could become inefficient. ... Stem cell restoration has already demonstrated therapeutic activities in certain systems. For example, it is known that after a stroke , endogenous stem cells are mobilized from the bone marrow in an attempt to heal the damaged neural tissue. Most interestingly, a recent study demonstrated that stroke patients who exhibit a high level of stem cell mobilization have better functional outcomes as opposed to patients with a lower mobilization. ... If [MSCs exhaustion syndrome] is true, then a stem cell therapy approach could be feasible. For instance, ex vivo expansion and reinfusion of MSCs from the patient\\'s own or from allogeneic donors , as evidence shows that MSCs are not immunogenic at all, have been already tested in many clinical trials .... In the best case scenario, MSCs therapy could retard the onset of irreversible lesions associated with metabolic syndrome or at least partially improve those already present.\" Link: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3118295/ July 1st, 2011 On Longevity Insurance Permalink (With Comments) Permalink (No Comments) Posted by Reason No Comments Yet Add a Comment It is worth watching the prevalence of longevity insurance offerings , as this is a measure of the degree to which the actuarial community and insurance industry believes that increases in human life span will happen in the near future, but that they will not be large. For the insurer, longevity insurance is a bet on earlier than anticipated death: \"Most people buy life insurance to protect against the risks of dying too soon. Now, there are new products offering the same protection if you live too long. It\\'s known as longevity insurance, and there\\'s clearly a huge market for it: Life expectancies are on the rise, cushy pensions are on the decline, and most people don\\'t have enough savings to carry them through two decades or more of retirement. This is not lost on insurance companies, which would like you to think about the product as a pension of sorts - albeit one that you have to buy with your own money. ... But what happens if Merck invents the magic pill and we all live until 105? ... Continued improvements in medicine that allow people to live longer could create losses on our individual annuity business. but these would be more than offset by higher gains on the life insurance. ... Still [if] something like that were to happen, \\'at some point, capacity might be limited.\\'\" Companies that bet against large increases in longevity are likely to suffer greatly in decades to come - which is unfortunate for the rest of us, because these concerns are large enough to run to the nearest government for a bailout, and thus we all end up paying for collective bad bets.

This year Giving Tuesday falls on December 1st. As I'm sure you're all aware, we're in the midst of raising funds for SENS rejuvenation research , the best and most effective of initiatives aimed at bringing aging under medical control. We have a little under $60,000 to go before the end of the year to hit our targets, and I'm pleased to note that if you donate to the SENS Research Foundation on December 1st your donation will be matched threefold - by the Fight Aging! matching fund, the Croeni Foundation , and Aubrey de Grey : SENS Research Foundation is getting ready to celebrate #GivingTuesday on December 1st. GivingTuesday is now a global event celebrated by supporters of various charities giving to their favorite causes. If you've been planning on contributing to the fight against age-related disease this year, GivingTuesday is a great opportunity to make a difference. So far, SENS Research Foundation has 3 matching grants set up for GivingTuesday. The first is our FightAging! Challenge which will match every dollar you give us up to $125,000. On GivingTuesday, the first $5,000 we raise will not be doubled or even tripled - it will be quadrupled thanks to the generosity of the Croeni Foundation and Aubrey de Grey.

This is the time for it. We stand in the initial years of a revolution in the capabilities and cost of biotechnology. Early stage research in the life sciences has become very cheap; a few tens of thousands of dollars can go a long way in an established laboratory, producing real progress at the cutting edge when spent wisely. Yet much of the necessary, revolutionary work in aging research is only funded by philanthropy, as traditional funding institutions are risk-averse and don't become involved until the prototypes are built, the case proven. In essence all important progress in medicine depends on the early participation of people like you and I, who are both aware of the possibilities, and interested enough in the outcome of greater healthy longevity to help make it happen. For most people, medical research is invisible. They'll never read about it, never think about it, until it is too late to have made a difference that mattered. Reading this, you have a chance to avoid that scenario. The more that is done now to start the avalanche of rejuvenation biotechnology development, the greater the results decades from now, at a time when aging is encroaching upon your health.

Climb the hill to get to the mountain. Conference series like SENS are one of the more visible signs of all of this work. You can take a look at the abstracts archive for SENS6 to see a selection of the topics that were on the program this year. Videos of the presentations from SENS5 in 2011 emerged online over the course of 2012. With luck that will be a faster process this year. Most are interesting and well worth the time taken to view.

Since 2003, he has organized bi-annual conferences, bringing together innovative biologists, medical researchers and a few policy wonks to share knowledge and perspectives, to coordinate and support each others\\' efforts. Below I report highlights from this year\\'s meeting, SENS 6, which I attended last week at Queens College, Cambridge. Exercise vs Caloric Restriction For the last ten yeas, Luigi Fontana of Washington University St Louis has been conducting an ongoing study of two groups of people who exercise fanatically (by middle-class US standards) and who seriously restrict their food intake (same standard). Both groups have dramatically improved biomarkers compared to the average American couch potato. DRACO - kills all virus-infected cells Todd Rider of MIT is quietly witty on-stage and charmingly self-effacing, but his program is radically ambitious. He wants to cure all infectious disease. DRACO is an acronym for Double-stranded RNA-Activated Caspase Oligomizer . The bottom line is that DRACO molecules can find cells that are infected with any virus, distinguish them from uninfected cells, and selectively signal the cell to destroy itself. It\\'s been tested in test tubes and in mice it cures, for example, the flu. Rider\\'s lab is producing only tiny quantities of DRACO at present, but by year\\'s end he hopes to ramp up production for much wider testing.

The SENS Research Foundation remains one of the very few philanthropic organizations focused on speeding the development of rejuvenation therapies - something we hope to see change in the years to come, as more support arrives for this field. The foundation staff use the charitable donations provided by our community to fund research programs specifically focused on areas of biotechnology that are presently blocked or neglected, but that can potentially give rise to ways to repair, remove, or work around the cell and tissue damage that causes aging . They also support networking, advocacy, and conference series designed to build bridges between academia and industry in order to smooth the road towards commercial development of advances developed in the laboratory. Along with the Methuselah Foundation , where the SENS rejuvenation research programs started, the SENS Research Foundation has done a great deal to change the way in which the scientific community and broader public view aging. Back at the turn of the century, when the SENS program was proposed , and Aubrey de Grey presented his synthesis of existing evidence for seven broad categories of molecular damage that caused aging, the leaders in the research and funding communities actively suppressed any effort to work on or discuss the treatment of aging as a medical condition. It was career suicide to openly work towards that goal. The change achieved since then has been profound, and now researchers openly debate how best to go about treating aging to extend healthy life spans. This required a great deal of hard work. A few strands of rejuvenation research have moved into clinical development in recent years: the removal of senescent cells , and clearance of a few kinds of harmful metabolic waste. As a part of its efforts, the SENS Research Foundation can now point to the ongoing development of startup biotechnology companies that it helped to seed fund, in some cases in partnership with the Methuselah Foundation. We will be seeing more of this in the years ahead: successful young companies can typically raise a great deal more funding than is available via philanthropy, and their efforts also go a long way towards attracting more validation and attention to the field. SENS Research Foundation 2018 Annual Report The valley of death - the chasm between innovation and availability that has become such a common theme in drug development - is especially wide for the field of rejuvenation biotechnology . Besides the time and resources required to develop any medicine, the few who initially strove to develop this field faced the added challenge of demonstrating that we could feasibly intervene to prevent age- related disease by redressing the underlying damage that causes such disease. There is scarcely a biotech organization that hasn\\'t used, at some point, a \\'bridging the gulf\\' metaphor to address the valley of death. But it has been such an integral part of our identity that we built it into our brand; the multi-colored ribbon of our logo having been designed to evoke both double-helix and suspension bridge imagery (and yes, it\\'s always had seven twists). Upon the launch of his project to build the Golden Gate Bridge , Chief Engineer Joseph Strauss had this to say: \"It took two decades and two hundred million words to convince people the bridge was feasible.\" We have at times wondered whether even that would be sufficient. But with the diligent efforts of our own research teams and those of a growing number of institutions, the question of feasibility has increasingly fallen away. Today we see our research programs successfully translating into development, our former students becoming rejuvenation biotechnologists and developers, new collaborative energy from the investment arena, and the groundwork being laid for regulatory models for rejuvenation interventions. Programmatic Investments Antoxerene , a portfolio company of Ichor Therapeutics , is a small molecule drug discovery company that focuses on molecular pathways of aging. To our knowledge, Antoxerene is the first and only company with small molecule hits on the p53/FOXO4 pathway , which has been implicated in cellular senescence . Antoxerene is developing these hits for eventual clinical use. Lysoclear , a portfolio company of Ichor Therapeutics, is an ophthalmology company developing an enzyme therapy for age-related macular degeneration and Stargardt\\'s disease . In 2017, the company completed pivotal proof-of-concept studies with its first generation enzyme lead and conducted extensive mechanistic work to clarify the role of retinal lipofuscin in the onset and progression of macular degeneration. These results have been submitted for peer-reviewed publication. Lysoclear is now optimizing its enzyme into a drug candidate in preparation for IND enabling studies. Oisín is developing a DNA construct that recognizes that a cell has become senescent and then destroys it, and safely and efficiently delivering this construct into cells throughout the body. Both goals have been achieved in pioneering proof of concept experiments in 2016. Now they are embarked on experiments that will show improvements in both healthspan and lifespan in model organisms from mice to primates. Arigos has made great strides towards the banking of human organs, demonstrating functional and structural recovery of similarly-sized tissues from below -120°C. Their ability to cryopreserve large, complex tissue structures is a breakthrough in medical research. Stable banking for larger tissue structures and organs could more than double the number of transplants performed each year and would eliminate five of the current organ waiting lists within a few years. Research The MitoSENS team is working on a potential rejuvenation biotechnology to sustain and recover electron transport chain (ETC) function: allotopic expression of functional mitochondrial genes . Allotopic expression involves placing \"backup copies\" of all of the protein-coding genes of the mitochondria in the \"safe harbor\" of the nucleus , which can then deliver the proteins mitochondria need to build their ETC and continue producing energy normally, even when the original mitochondrial copies have been mutated. The team is working to establish a \"landing pad\" in mouse cells to enable reliable and safe gene therapy for animal studies, via the Maximally-Modifiable Mouse Project . They expect to soon begin preliminary in vivo testing of allotopic ATP8 in transgenic mice. Meanwhile, they are also looking to expand the strategy to other mitochondrial genes and further improve allotopic expression of the ATP6 gene. A major cause of crosslink accumulation in aging is Advanced Glycation Endproducts (AGE) , and one AGE in particular - called glucosepane - is currently thought to be the single largest contributor to tissue AGE crosslinking, with consequences such as arterial stiffening. The Yale team is developing new reagents and approaches to accelerate glucosepane research. They now are able to synthesize all three conformational variants ( diastereomers ) of glucosepane that may occur in vivo . They are also working to generate antibodies that can then be used to label glucosepane crosslinks in tissue samples and in vivo. Further, the Yale team has identified some potential glucosepane-breakers, about which we hope to be able to make further announcements this year pending publication in a peer-reviewed journal. One of the reasons why senescent cells secrete inflammatory signals is to attract Natural Killer (NK) immune cells , which then clear senescent cells from the tissue. Despite this, senescent cells accumulate over the course of the lifespan. A critical question is therefore that of how some senescent cells are able to escape immune surveillance and what might be done to overcome their defenses. Dr. Judith Campisi , a renowned pioneer in senescence research, is answering this question and developing strategies to enhance immune clearance of senescent cells. Campisi\\'s group has already discovered that one of the key NK cell binding markers on the surface of senescent cells begins to disappear within weeks of the cell becoming senescent. Without this marker ligand , NK cell binding cannot occur, and the NK cells\\' killing ability cannot be unleashed. Early results suggest some potential strategies for restoring NK cell immunosurveillance of senescent cells. Aggregates composed of aberrant tau protein accumulate with age, both inside and outside of neurons . These aggregates are an important driver of neurodegenerative diseases of aging. One possible basis for this intracellular accumulation may be as a consequence of age-related lysosomal dysfunction that is driven by the accumulation of other kinds of intracellular aggregates. As such, this deleterious accumulation might be reversed if lysosomal function could be restored . This line of investigation will inform strategy: do we need a custom solution just for intracellular tau aggregates, or will clearing other age-related lysosomal junk be sufficient to restore an existing capacity to eliminate these aggregates? The Andersen lab is testing this possibility using neurons that express mutant versus wild-type human tau. Atherosclerotic lesions form when immune cells called macrophages take in 7-ketocholesterol (7-KC) and other damaged cholesterol byproducts in an effort to protect the arterial wall from their toxicity but ultimately fall prey to that same toxicity themselves. Dr. O\\'Connor\\'s team has identified a family of small molecules that may be able to selectively remove toxic forms of cholesterol from human blood, which would help combat the development of atherosclerosis . They have been testing its effects and those of closely-related compounds in human blood samples, seeking potential modifications and combinations that would maximize selectivity for toxic cholesterol byproducts while leaving native cholesterol alone.', 'title': 'SENS Research Foundation 2017-2018 Annual Report', 'url': 'https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2018/05/sens-research-foundation-2017-2018-annual-report/', 'publish_date': '2018-05-11', 'start_index': 1641}, page_content='openly debate how best to go about treating aging to extend healthy life spans.

We are helping to fund the work needed to produce actual, working rejuvenation therapies soon enough to matter, treatments that can target and repair the fundamental causes of aging. Aging is caused by a few forms of molecular damage that accrue in cells and tissues, a sort of slow biological wear and tear that results from the normal operation of metabolism. Given the right lines of research, that damage can be repaired, and thus the clock turned back, age-related disease prevented or effectively treated. Those research programs are outlined in the SENS vision , and have been underway for some years now, making steady progress with the support of everyday philanthropists like you and I. At the start of November, Josh Triplett and Fight Aging! put up a $24,000 challenge fund for new SENS Patrons: everyone who signs up before the end of the year to make a regular monthly donation to the SENS Research Foundation will have the next year of donations matched dollar for dollar. I'm pleased to announce that this past weekend, Christophe and Dominique Cornuejols stepped up to contribute another $12,000 to the fund. You might recall that they also provided a matching fund to help in the last days of the universal cancer therapy crowdfunding effort earlier this year. It is a privilege to have had the support of these folk over the past few years of Fight Aging! fundraisers. The SENS Patron challenge fund was $24,000, and is now $36,000. That means we're looking for more SENS Patrons to take the plunge and help to extend and broaden the research success produced by the SENS Research Foundation and their allies in past years. We live in exciting times when it comes to medicine for human rejuvenation, with senescent cell clearance therapies now in well-funded clinical development and other lines of research threatening to follow in the years ahead. The transition is underway from the medicine of the past, that did not in any meaningful way address the molecular damage that causes aging and age-related disease, to the medicine of the future, in which that damage is targeted for repair. We will have longer, healthier lives thanks to the efforts of SENS advocates and researchers, and thanks to the many people whose charitable donations have allowed this work to take place at all. It has been a tough job to bootstrap a new field of medicine from scratch, in the face of all of those who said it couldn't be done or shouldn't be done. There are certainly fewer naysayers now that the wheel is beginning to turn, however, and now that the first rejuvenation research startup companies are working on bringing therapies to the clinic. Researchers talk openly about targeting the processes of aging, and there is enthusiasm for progress in many parts of the research and development communities. This is the time for advocates and donors to push harder, to build atop present success, to lay the foundations for the next set of treatments to emerge in the years ahead. There are seven classes of cell and tissue damage involved in aging, and only two or three of those could be said to be proceeding at a productive pace today: senescent cell clearance, stem cell research, and some forms of amyloid clearance . The others are just as important, but still languishing, with comparatively little funding, and yet to reach the tipping point that senescent cell clearance reached in the past few years. When that point arrives for a specific line of research it becomes a pretty fast ride from a few groups in the laboratory to multiple venture funded companies working on clinical applications of longevity science, but getting there is up to us. To a first approximation no-one cares about funding fundamental medical research, and the most important work is near always heavily funded by visionaries and philanthropists, rather the established funding institutions. It is really, really hard to raise funding for radical new approaches in medicine - until the researchers can prove that they work. See what David Spiegel of the noted Spiegel Laboratory at Yale had to say on that topic, for example: The SENS Research Foundation funding has been critical to our work studying and developing methods to reverse the effects of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) in aging. AGEs are non-enzymatic modifications that build up on proteins as people age, leading to inflammation and tissue damage. Early on, our lab focused significant effort on developing the first total synthesis of glucosepane - a major AGE cross-link found in human tissues - but we were unable to find funding from any of the traditional sources. The SENS Research Foundation came to our aid, and supported this research for over 5 years. In 2015, our glucosepane synthesis efforts were published in Science , and lay a foundation for developing drugs capable of detecting and reversing tissue damage in aging. We are deeply grateful to the SENS Research Foundation and Fight Aging! for all of their support and look forward to exciting, life-extending work to come! The work of the Spiegel Laboratory will form the foundation of an approach to treat aging that will be just as important as senescent cell clearance. But like so many vital lines of research related to the future of rejuvenation therapies, and like so many vital lines of research in the broader field of medicine, funding just can't be found through the existing establishment. That is why our fundraisers and our acts of advocacy are so very important. The future is in our hands: we are the ones who raise up the lantern and shine a light on the research and development that must happen; who call for assistance and vote with our wallets; who raise the profile of this work; who provide the funding needed for prototypes and further evidence; and who start the ball rolling. When high net worth individuals join in, when the institutions finally pay attention, when the venture capitalists fund companies, it is because we took action, and because we did our part to show the way. So join in!\"}, page_content=\"to extend and broaden the research success produced by the SENS Research Foundation and their allies in past years. We live in exciting times when it comes to medicine for human rejuvenation, with senescent cell clearance therapies now in well-funded clinical development and other lines of research threatening to follow in the years ahead. The transition is underway from the medicine of the past, that did not in any meaningful way address the molecular damage that causes aging and age-related disease, to the medicine of the future, in which that damage is targeted for repair. We will have longer, healthier lives thanks to the efforts of SENS advocates and researchers, and thanks to the many people whose charitable donations have allowed this work to take place at all. It has been a tough job to bootstrap a new field of medicine from scratch, in the face of all of those who said it couldn't be done or shouldn't be done.

There's still time to register: a group of exceptional figures in aging research and related fields in medicine and the broader life sciences will gather to talk about how to greatly extend healthy human life, with the focus being on how to best move ahead in the implementation of the SENS proposals for rejuvenation biotechnology : The purpose of the SENS conference series, like all the SENS initiatives, is to expedite the development of truly effective therapies to postpone and treat human aging by tackling it as an engineering problem: not seeking elusive and probably illusory magic bullets, but instead enumerating the accumulating molecular and cellular changes that eventually kill us and identifying ways to repair - to reverse - those changes, rather than merely to slow down their further accumulation. This broadly defined regenerative medicine - which includes the repair of living cells and extracellular material in situ - applied to damage of aging, is what we refer to as rejuvenation biotechnologies. As usual, the conference has a great line up of speakers , and the range of abstracts for presentation is well worth reading if you'd like to get an idea as to what people are working on these days. Not all of it is directly relevant to SENS, but that's the way these things go: people come to learn and be swayed as much to present the work they're presently engaged in. The SENS Research Foundation staff are presently publishing a steady flow of speaker highlights for the forthcoming conference, and here are the latest in line: SENS6 Speaker Highlight: Todd Rider Dr. Rider's most recent efforts have led to a remarkable development within the PANACEA (Pharmacological Augmentation of Nonspecific Anti-pathogen Cellular Enzymes and Activities) project. This new treatment is known as DRACO , which stands for Double-stranded RNA Activated Caspase Oligomizer. Essentially, DRACO works by triggering apoptosis in cells that contain viral double-stranded RNA , an indicator that they have been infected by a virus. Non-infected cells, on the other hand, are not affected by the treatment. Based on the tests that have been performed so far, DRACO has the potential to be effective against nearly any virus. Trials done in vitro or in mice have shown that DRACO kills cells infected with the common cold, H1N1 influenza , dengue fever virus, a polio virus, and others. Meanwhile, the treatment has been shown to be nontoxic to all of the cell types tested, including those from humans. SENS6 Speaker Highlight: Robin Franklin Many diseases mirror some aspect of aging. Multiple sclerosis (MS) , which is caused by the loss of the myelin coating that protects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, is one example: myelin is also lost and poorly replaced in normal aging. Scientists like Cambridge's Dr. Robin Franklin, a SENS6 speaker, are working hard to repair this damage. To learn how the axons of nerve cells might best be remyelinated, Dr. Franklin has been studying the cellular and molecular aspects of the process. Stem cells in the brain differentiate into oligodendrocytes , which are responsible for remyelination. However, these stem cells have an increasingly difficult time differentiating in an aging brain. This low level of differentiation may also cause multiple sclerosis, such that true damage repair therapies for MS might also be effective against age-related neurodegeneration. SENS6 Speaker Highlight: Alan Russell Dr. Russell has founded several biotech companies, including Agentase, LLC and NanoSembly, LLC, and holds fourteen patents. His many honors include the R&D 100 Award, the National Academy of Engineering's Gilbreth lectureship, and the University of Manchester's Outstanding Alumnus Award. At SENS6, Dr. Russell's talk will focus on the disruptive potential of tissue engineering . He will discuss the great promise of growing new organs to replace failing ones, addressing the underlying cause of disease. He will also cover the problems that tissue engineering faces - among them, its lack of market adoption - and propose solutions. Finally, he will describe some of the research being conducted in his own leading laboratory. This includes work on engineering cell membranes , and using cytotactic surfaces to change the direction that cells roll.\", 'start_index': 41, 'url': 'https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2013/07/the-sens6-conference-is-coming-up-soon/', 'title': 'The SENS6 Conference is Coming Up Soon', 'publish_date': '2013-07-16'}, page_content=\"The sixth Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS) conference will be held in Cambridge, England this coming September.

Please do drop by and take a look at what we\\'re working on. Elsewhere, in the land of wishful thinking : The Vegas Group came together formally sometime in 2016, though the first kick-off meeting was the year prior at one of the bi-annual conventions for longevity research held in California.  ... The Vegas Group was a natural outgrowth of a decade of advocacy and anticipation for human enhancement technologies, coupled with the frustrating realization that no such technologies would be meaningfully developed, never mind made available to the public, under the regulatory regimes then in place in the US and Europe. ... by 2017 the direct action contingent of the Vegas Group consisted of about a hundred people all told. Their declared objective was a distributed collaborative effort to (a) develop human versions of the most successful longevity and metabolic enhancements demonstrated in mice, and (b) cultivate hospitable medical groups in the Asia-Pacific countries. It is clear to me that this sort of strategy will be (and is) very necessary as a part of the process of pushing the bounds of medical technology - which is advancing nowhere near as rapidly as it might be. Stunning progress in the laboratory doesn\\'t translate into stunning progress in the clinic, and this is because of the oppressive shroud of regulation weighing down the entire industry. Can you imagine a world in which it took ten years and a government agency to clear the latest innovations in processors and hard drives? We\\'d still be stuck with 70s-era computers, and paying ten times the price. Yet in medicine, this is exactly the situation we find ourselves in ; a worse product, slow progress, and massive expense. By way of a reminder, it is illegal in the US to commercially develop and market medical technologies for the purpose of slowing or reversing aging. I\\'ll stop to let that sink in for a moment, for those of you who didn\\'t know this. The unelected and largely unaccountable bureaucrats of the FDA do not recognize aging as a disease, therefore will not approve any treatment for aging - and so anyone who forges ahead to try it will be shut down and prosecuted. If you ever wondered why, in this age of remarkable advances and plummeting costs in biotechnology, there are not a thousand startup companies striking out to take on aging itself ... well, this is why. Pushing change through the FDA is a glacial and very expensive process of lobbying - a political process, naturally, which must be well lubricated with money that would be far better spent on research. This is what it is: essentially corrupt, utterly hostile to progress, a system in which the incentives are for regulators to cause delay and obstruction. Absent a revolution, a broken system of governance should be avoided and worked around, not engaged. When you engage with that broken system, all you are doing is propping it up and legitimizing its existence while it has its way with you. So I have been pondering how best to make the vision of the Vegas Group a reality: what steps do we take so that we wake up six or seven years from now to an open source biotech community whose members are working on enabling the best longevity therapies produced by the formal research community - and who have the overseas connections to enable responsible use of resulting therapies in a clinical setting. The social and regulatory change required to make this happen legally in the US is so great - and so contrary to the present downward spiral towards more government and greater regulation in every aspect of life - that from where I stand, efforts are better directed towards progress in biotechnology. So what components are needed to move this from pipe dream to reality? In no particular order: An open repository of technical information: a Wikipedia of longevity biotechnology and published research, a resource built by a community into a how-to for specific techniques in longevity science. Persuading a sizable segment of the present open biotech community into finding this grand project interesting enough to support, and interesting enough to work on. Bootstrapping a community of project supporters large enough to raise funding, hold conferences, and become self-sustaining. In many ways, I see this sort of thing as the answer to \"what comes next after the SENS Foundation ?\" When the SENS Foundation is forging through the waves five years from now, making progress and getting things done in repairing the biochemical damage of aging , what are the new and energetic research-focused organizations springing up at that time? How are they organized? What are their strategies for turning this growing sea of practical possibilities for repairing aging into therapies for humans? I see the SENS Foundation and similarly focused organizations as covering the mainstream approach to science, which is to say it will be a slow process moving from working results in the laboratory to therapies in humans. By the very nature of the Foundation, its legitimacy in the eyes of people that matter, the ones writing the checks, depends on going through the established system of research and regulation, FDA and all. That is their fight. I don\\'t believe that we can afford to wait for the additional ten years or however many years it requires to win that fight, however. Not if there are other options on the table that may enable us to move faster. The Vegas Group approach is one such option: take the knowledge and techniques published by the research community into open biotech communities and overseas laboratories for further development, work them up to a level at which people are comfortable with the risks, and try them out. You get things done by getting things done. After all, these are our lives. Ours. We are not serfs, to be the property of faceless bureaucrats in the FDA. We can choose our own risks, just as many open biotech enthusiasts would choose to work on biotechnologies of rejuvenation that will ultimately benefit all of humanity.

At a $3 million yearly budget, the Foundation's reach is no longer a group that you can fit into a small photograph: there are small laboratories in a number of research establishments around the world, a bunch of folk in the Bay Area, and a broad network of advisors, just to start with. You all recognize the SENS Research Foundation cofounder Aubrey de Grey , of course, but there are many more people working away on the foundations of rejuvenation biotechnology and they deserve their time in the spotlight. So the Foundation is running a series of profiles at the moment: funded researchers, interns, volunteers, advocates, conference speakers, advisors, and others - people who are working to ensure that you and I have a shot at living much longer healthy lives while evading the pain and suffering caused by untreated aging. I linked to some of these profiles a few weeks ago , and here are more in the same vein: SENS6 Speaker Highlight: Dr. George Church The SENS6 conference's keynote address will be delivered by Dr. George Church , a researcher widely considered a luminary in modern biotechnology with over 300 publications to date. Dr. Church may be best known for his key role in the Human Genome Project , which he helped initiate and drive. His genomic sequencing innovations have led him to be involved with most of the companies in that field, either as a co-founder, advisor, or provider of licensed technology. At SENS6, Dr. Church's presentation will address his cutting-edge work on bringing CRISPR-associated systems , an adaptive immune defense of some single-celled organisms that uses short strands of RNA , to human cells. He will also discuss the latest sequencing technologies, and the need to supplement genomic information with environmental and trait data. SENS6 Speaker Highlight: Dr. Felipe Sierra Dr. Felipe Sierra stands out for his unifying vision and deep involvement in aging research. [He is] the head of the National Institute on Aging's Division of Aging Biology (DAB) . The DAB studies the aging process itself; the remits of its various branches are genetics and cell biology, the effects of cellular and molecular changes on tissue function, and animal models of human aging. Instead of funding work about the mechanisms or progression of age-related diseases, the DAB supports work that elucidates why exactly it is that older adults suffer from these diseases while younger ones do not. At SENS6 , Dr. Sierra will give a presentation about [the Geroscience Interest Group ] and the fundamental process that underlies the diseases of aging. He will be joined at the conference by many other top scientists, including Harvard's George Church, the Mayo Clinic's Jan van Deursen , Carnegie Mellon's Alan Russell , and MIT's Todd Rider . Intern Sam Curran: IDing Senescent Cell Secretion Potentially Implicated In Age-Related Decline Of Immune System Function Senescent cells [contribute to] pathologies associated with old age , such as tissue degeneration. Is there a way to target and treat the afflicted cells responsible [here]? This is the question being addressed [by] Sam Curran. In the summer of 2012 as part of the SENS Research Foundation Summer Internship Program, Sam joined Dr. Judith Campisi's laboratory at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging to work on a project dealing with the senescence phenotype of mesenchymal stem cells . After the success of his summer project, Sam was invited by the Campisi lab to continue his research for a year of full-time funding by the SENS Research Foundation. Since his summer internship ended, Sam has made a number of novel discoveries. For instance, the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) of MSCs may be different than other cells due to their immunosuppressive secretions. Sam has already identified one senescence-associated immunosuppressive factor that may be implicated in two important biological phenomenon: the ability of senescent cells to evade immune-surveillance and age-related decline of immune system function. Sam hopes to identify additional immunosuppressive MSC SASP factors with yet another year of funded research in the Campisi lab before pursuing a Ph.D. in bioengineering in the fall of 2014. Haroldo Silva: Lead OncoSENS Scientist Researches Telomere Lengthening and Cancer Pathways I was a doctoral student at the University of California, Berkeley, in the department of Bioengineering. My dissertation laboratory at UC Berkeley is known for cutting-edge aging research and that was one of the reasons I joined that group in the first place. I also attended a seminar at Berkeley given by Aubrey de Grey which really opened my eyes about the real possibilities of a novel perspective on aging research transforming the world in our lifetime. I am the lead scientist of the OncoSENS team at SRF . Our group seeks to uncover the genetic pathways and mechanisms that enable cancer cells to acquire unlimited cellular division. One of the major hurdles cancer cells need to overcome is how to keep the ends of their chromosomes (i.e., telomeres ) from shortening with each cell division. A major pathway exploited by cancer cells to elongate their telomeres is upregulation of an enzyme called telomerase . However, about 10-15% of cancers do not have any detectable telomerase activity and thus operate via another pathway called Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) . The goal of our research team is to find out which specific genes are responsible for ALT activity in these cancers. Therefore, in theory, removal of both telomerase and ALT genes from the genome should eradicate cancer completely. Connie Wang: Microglia, Aging and Alzheimer's During her time at Caltech, Connie has engaged in a variety of research interests.  She has conducted plant genetics research to determine whether a strain of Mimulus was a distinct subspecies and also helped design an optical coherence tomography (OCT) system for use in retinal surgery. In 2012, she participated in the SENS Research Foundation Summer Internship Program. During her time at the SRF Research Center in Mountain View, California, she developed microglial cell assays that helped lay the groundwork for studying the relationship between microglia, aging, and Alzheimer's Disease . This summer, Connie is working with the Reichert lab at Duke University to develop an angiogenesis -promoting system for glucose sensors planted under the skin with the goal of making them a viable long-term solution for insulin-dependent diabetics. She will return to Caltech in the fall to begin her final year of study before applying to graduate school in 2014.\", 'publish_date': '2013-07-02', 'start_index': 4860, 'title': 'More New Faces at the SENS Research Foundation', 'url': 'https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2013/07/more-new-faces-at-the-sens-research-foundation/'}, page_content='phenomenon: the ability of senescent cells to evade immune-surveillance and age-related decline of immune system function.

This is a most interesting, and I think worthwhile, way for an author or journalist to approach the long-form interview process. Like many other new approaches this wouldn\\'t have been financially viable a few decades ago, and is in and of itself a small example of the sort of freedom, choice, and innovation that can occur when costs fall and barriers to entry crumble. At the present time, we can hope that the same things that have already happened to the publishing industry will also come to pass for the edifice of medical research and development: an explosion of greater participation, experimentation, and creation. These two areas of human endeavor couldn\\'t be more different in their details, but in both cases the costs of participation are falling dramatically. Aubrey de Grey needs little introduction for the long-time readers here. Something more than fifteen years ago he took it upon himself, as an outsider to the field at the time, to alternately kick and persuade the aging research community into working towards the treatment of aging. When he surveyed the field, he saw plenty of evidence to show that aging is caused by a small variety of forms of cell and tissue damage . Yet that evidence was largely ignored in the formulation of research strategy, while scientific discussion the treatment of aging in public was a threat to career and funding , and the vast majority of aging research was nothing more than a process of gathering data. Fast forward to today, however, and this situation has been turned around. Arguments among scientists are now over how exactly aging should be treated in order to prevent disease and extend healthy life, and researchers can speak in public and publish their thoughts on that goal without any fear of losing their ability to raise funding or advance their careers. This was achieved through considerable effort by a network of advocates within and beyond the research community, and few would argue that de Grey was anything other than one of the most important of these figures. He now leads the scientific and funding efforts of the SENS Research Foundation, an organization that, along with its parent non-profit the Methuselah Foundation , has accomplished a great deal in moving the vision of rejuvenation therapies closer to reality. Clearing senescent cells as a way to treat aging, for example, was dismissed by many in the research community a decade ago despite the strong evidence for its role in age-related degeneration. Today, however, therapies to clear senescent cells from old tissues have been demonstrated to improve health and extend life in rodent studies, the research non-profit Major Mouse Testing Program is crowdfunding further studies , and two startup companies, Oisin Biotechnologies and UNITY Biotechnology , are working on bringing these treatments to the clinic.

Advancing Conversations: Aubrey de Grey - Advocate For An Indefinite Human Lifespan Advancing Conversations is a line of interview books documenting conversations with artists, authors, philosophers, economists, scientists, and activists whose works are aimed at the future and at progress. The biogerontologist Aubrey de Grey, as the world\\'s pre-eminent longevity advocate, is nothing if not future oriented. De Grey is the founder of the SENS Research Foundation, an organization developing medical interventions to repair the damage the body does to itself over time. Stated more directly, Aubrey de Grey and his organization aim to defeat aging. Douglas Lain : I thought I\\'d start our conversation with a joke from Louis CK. Louis says that when you\\'re forty and you go to the doctor, they don\\'t try to fix anything anymore. Once you get over forty they don\\'t try to fix you, they just say \"Yeah, that starts to happen.\" Is this really a general attitude that people have, that there is any truth to this joke? Aubrey de Grey : Yes. There is an enormous amount of truth in it. And I think we need to distinguish here a little bit between the medical progression - doctors and other people in the medical world - as against the rest of the world. The medical progression have the enormous problem, which we need to sympathize with, that they have a certain range of tools to work with, to help people to be healthier and to restore people to health, but those tools are very limited in their efficacy. In particular they\\'re extremely limited with regard to what they can do for people who are getting old. Ultimately, your average doctor just has to work with what they have, and a lot of that involves management of expectations. That\\'s really all the Louis CK is saying there. Right? Of course, that doesn\\'t say anything about what might happen in the future. What might be possible in terms of maintenance or restoration of youthful good health with medicines that haven\\'t yet been developed. But, that is not what doctors are supposed to be interested in. Doctors are all about doing their best with the tools that are already available. Now contrast that with the situation that the general public has. The general public are not providing care, they are the recipient of medical care. And they are the people who should be thinking about the potential improvement in that medical care that might arise from further advances, from progress in the laboratory. It\\'s kind of beholden on the public and therefore policy makers and opinion formers and so on ... to actually drive this, to actually deliver the funding and general resources that are required to allow people like SENS Research Foundation to move forward and create therapies that don\\'t yet exist. Once those therapies do exist, of course they enter the universe of tools that your doctor can actually prescribe, can actually administer. But until that time, it\\'s not the problem of the doctors.

The scientific culture and scientific process as it is practiced today embodies a strong bias against any sort of shortcut towards the production of technology, however. If it seems plausible at a lesser level of understanding of a system that you could achieve some beneficial application, then the peer pressure in the scientific community is always to hold off and work instead towards a full understanding. This situation is not uncommon in medicine: many discoveries are serendipitous, but to try to turn demonstrated positive results in the laboratory into positive results in the clinic will be opposed at every turn until the underlying mechanisms can be fully explained. The bias against action and towards understanding as the primary goal is baked into every level of the research establishment and surrounding institutions. The scientific method has researchers moving eternally towards greater understanding. It has nothing to say about what you do with that understanding, however. Application to produce technology is where you step from the Platonic ideal and into the messy real work of engineering: the art of creating meaningful solutions in the absence of full understanding. This boundary between knowledge and technology produces all sorts of cultural friction, and I think it is fair to say that scientists who depart to be engineers are not treated as well as they might be by their former peers. There is little disapproval in the world quite like that of pure scientists directed towards one of their own who steps away to start a technology business. At root there are very good reasons for this bias: the scientific method is required for progress, yet it is constantly under attack from opportunists and fallible human nature: wishful thinking, the desire to find progress where there is none, the desire for short-term gain over long-term gain, and so forth. If shortcuts are not treated as heresy, then there will be all too many research programs led astray, and development predicated on false results, and in the worst cases outright fraud. This happens even with the scientific culture of disapproval, but far less so than it otherwise might. While the core of the scientific method is centuries old, to some degree this strong bias against early attempts at practical application is a phenomenon of modern times. In the institution of medical research everything that moves beyond early stage exploration must be explicable to the standards of the day, but matters were not always so rigorous. There any number of grandfathered treatments available today that are not sufficiently well understood at the level of molecular biology to get into clinical trials if they were discovered today. Regulation as it stands today in the US states that you shall only treat named conditions, and you shall present a full understanding of how you are doing it. Since everything else is actually outright forbidden, you end up with a situation in which all funding and effort - even back down the chain to supposedly unconnected free-ranging fundamental research - is focused on the molecular biology of late stage disease and the proximate causes thereof. For most researchers that's the only work with a future if you want to contribute to something that might actually end up approved for clinical use. So these influential edifices of thought, and all the funding that is influenced by them, say that any approach in research that specifically aims to circumvent our lack of knowledge in some areas is simply Not The Done Thing. Yet there are many lines of research in which it is clearly plausible that great benefits could be derived by doing just this, and - as currently constructed - the walls that the scientific institution is forced to erect for its own defense exclude all of this good, solid work that might lead to better therapies. As one example you might look at leukocyte/granulocyte transfer therapies for cancer . These came to prominence on the basis of very promising results in animal studies, but have not seen significantly funding or much work on human studies precisely because researchers cannot yet present a full accounting of how these treatments work. Without that, you won't see much movement. In this context we of course come to the Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS) . This is not just a proposal for the shortest path to the best results when treating aging, a research plan to create rejuvenation in the old and prevent all age-related frailty and disease, it is also a critique of the scientific community and its way of doing business. The present system is broken by virtue of the fact that its members have gone too far in building defenses against failure modes in the scientific method. They now systematically marginalize useful endeavors aimed at the production of meaningful results in absence of complete knowledge of the biological systems involved. Application of partial knowledge can be good engineering, and is viable, necessary, and needed in medicine, where every delay costs lives. The past shows that the engineering approach can be perfectly workable, as many drugs in use today were brought into use through exactly this sort of methodology, and their full mechanisms are in fact still not understood. Still, the mainstream of the aging research community will continue to spend billions on efforts that have no greater expectation of practical utility than the sirtuin research of the past decade . They are working towards a full understanding of the overlap of metabolism and aging as a primary objective. This in and of itself is a fine thing if knowledge is the desired end result, but I object to its presentation as a sensible path toward therapies to extend healthy life to any significant degree in the near future. This is just not plausible for the drug development approach to altering metabolism : the best that might be done here in the next couple of decades is to gently slow the progress of aging. Researchers involved tend to think that adding five years of healthy life by 2030 is an ambitious goal. If that five years is all that happens, and when it does it certainly won't be five years for those people already old when treatments arrive, then what a waste of opportunity that would be. No, we want to see work on rejuvenation, on ways to reverse aging by repairing its causes - work after the SENS model that has a clear plan to produce results in absence of a full understanding of metabolism throughout aging. What is needed is a comprehensive list of damage that distinguishes old tissues from young tissues. This exists, and given this list there is no great need to fully understand how the damage interacts and progresses in intricate detail: researchers just need to periodically repair it. In this environment drawing more researchers to work on SENS repair biotechnologies is a bootstrapping process of attention and funding and results, just like the disruption of any industry by new technologies and new approaches. Things like clearance of senescent cells seem like one of the areas of research that will eventually get grudging attention by virtue of the fact that it will work far more effectively than anything the mainstream is producing with their drugs and their messing with the operation of metabolism in the late stages of disease. If you are trying to make a damaged engine work slightly better when damaged, rather than trying to address the damage itself, why would you expect good results? The replacement of the present mainstream culture of aging research by SENS-like research focused on periodic repair of the causes of aging to achieve rejuvenation will proceed gradually and through the demonstration of effectiveness. There is a lot of of replacing to be done, however. It's a long road yet, and conservative institutions will continue to support work that does nothing but add knowledge of the fine details of metabolism long after rejuvenation research is much more of a going concern, I'd imagine. Groups like Google's Calico venture do not fund SENS because they are run by exemplars of the current institutions of medical science, who have worked their entire careers in the world of full knowledge as a requirement and where the primary strategy is a struggle to alter metabolism in the late stages of age-related disease, people who live and breath the drug pipeline and FDA dictates. Why should it be any surprise that what they are going to do is simply a continuation of existing programs of aging research? Calico will fund SENS at the same time that other institutions of the mainstream are doing so as a matter of course, which is to say when the disruption has come full circle and when people talk about aging research they usually mean the SENS approach of repair of primary causes.\", 'start_index': 4089, 'title': 'The Scientific Institution is Biased Against Shortcuts to the Production of Practical Technology', 'publish_date': '2015-01-07'}, page_content=\"therapies for cancer .

This scientific conference will focus on rejuvenation research in the same manner as the SENS conference series that ran from 2003 to 2013 under the auspices of the Methuselah Foundation and, later, the SENS Research Foundation . Undoing Aging is a collaboration between the SENS Research Foundation and Forever Healthy Foundation , the latter being the organization founded by SENS patron Michael Greve. You might recall that in 2016 Greve pledged $10 million to fund rejuvenation research and resulting startup companies, becoming the first donor to the SENS Project|21 initiative . As the first rejuvenation therapies near human trials and clinical availability, it becomes ever more important to expand the size of the research community presently working on ways to repair the causes of aging. As Aubrey de Grey has pointed out , there is a great deal left to accomplish on the way to a toolkit of therapies capable of turning back aging and extending healthy life spans by even a few decades. That work requires funding, and interested researchers, public support. That in turn requires networking, persuasion, and a showcasing of promising work currently in progress. In years to come, everyone will say that the strategy of repairing the cell and tissue damage of aging was obvious in hindsight - but we need their support now, when it matters, when there is work yet to accomplish, not after the fact. It is the eternal challenge of bootstrapping a movement, an industry, a research community. Conferences play an important role in this process. Undoing Aging 2018 Conference Announces Program and Speakers The SENS Research Foundation and the Forever Healthy Foundation today announced the 2018 Undoing Aging Conference program and speakers. Undoing Aging will take place March 15 - 17, 2018 at the Umspannwerk Alexanderplatz in Berlin, Germany. Undoing Aging 2018 is focused on the cellular and molecular repair of age-related damage as the basis of therapies to bring aging under full medical control. The conference, a joint effort of SENS Research Foundation and Forever Healthy Foundation, provides a platform for the existing scientific community that already works on damage repair and, at the same time, offers interested scientists and students a first-hand understanding of the current state of this exciting new field of biomedical research. Undoing Aging 2018 Program I have regretted not having thought of the title \"Undoing aging\" for our 2007 book \" Ending Aging \", ever since a reader accidentally used that name for it in an email to us. I am thus delighted to have this opportunity to use it now. It perfectly encapsulates the nature of the approach to maintaining youthfulness in old age that SENS Research Foundation pursues: the repair of the self-inflicted damage that the body generates as side-effects of essential metabolic processes . This conference will, accordingly, mirror the structure of SENS, with sessions devoted to each strand and to the enabling technologies that multiple strands will rely upon. Those of you who attended any of the conferences we organised in Cambridge, from 2003 to 2013, will notice the similarity - and indeed, the similarities will not end there! Two of the seven SENS damage categories consist of the elimination of cells that we have too many of: either because they are dividing too much (which is essentially the definition of cancer) or because they are not dying when they should. The most promising truly general anti-cancer therapies each merit multiple talks, so we have a session for each, as well as one for the \"death-resistant cells\" category. Russell and Hawthorne will present novel methods for weakening the ability of cancer (or indeed any) cells to render themselves invisible to the immune system , while Silva and Gorbunova will update us on ways to manipulate telomere elongation and thereby limit proliferation capacity. Kirkland , Lewis , and de Keizer will then discuss the range of methods currently under development for selectively eliminating cells that are doing us more harm than good: small molecules , suicide genes , and engineered peptides .\\u200b\\u200b The two SENS categories that have, arguably, seen the greatest contribution from research funded by SRF are those relating to damage within cells: mitochondrial mutations and \"garbage\". Our in-house team has made immense progress recently in rendering mitochondrial mutations harmless by installing \"backup copies\" in the nuclear genome , and O\\'Connor will provide updates on where that work stands. Honkanen and Moody will describe the state of play in relation to elimination of the two best-characterised types of intracellular garbage that drive major age-related diseases, namely atherosclerosis and macular degeneration .\\u200b Extracellular changes play a major role in mediating the loss of function of cells and tissues. Talks in this part of the conference will cover a variety of such problems. Paul and Graef will present novel approaches to the removal of aggregated material, notably the protein transthyretin which misfolds particularly easily and may be the main factor responsible both for important diseases and for mortality in very old age. Spiegel and Clark are both researching the stiffening of the extracellular matrix , a process that contributes both to life-threatening and to cosmetic aspects of aging. Wagers\\' focus will be the role of circulating proteins in mediating and counteracting age-related deleterious changes of gene expression in a wide range of tissues.\\u200b In an ideal world, the whole of SENS would be viewed as regenerative medicine , since it is all about restoring structure to restore function; but that term has too much history to be broadened in such a way, so we adhere to its standard usage covering just stem cell therapy and tissue engineering . The manipulation of stem cells to generate safe and effective therapeutic reagents has advanced by leaps and bounds recently, and West , Sen , and Loring are among the absolute leaders in this burgeoning area, especially where age-related conditions are concerned. The replacement of entire organs from a variety of sources may soon be far more practical than hitherto, and Atala , Lemaitre , and Jones will describe three radically new approaches to addressing the still-acute shortage of organs for transplant. Finally, the restoration of organ function can in principle be achieved not only via one-for-one replacement of a malfunctioning organ, but through more distributed means where a single \" organoid \" only partially substitutes; Lagasse will present one highly novel approach along these lines.\\u200b Most of SENS is still at a pre-clinical stage of development, where evidence of safety and efficacy can be obtained via short cuts that would not be available when treating humans. SRF has, therefore, always set its priorities both near-term and long-term, funding proof-of-concept research alongside work that will only have clear utility further downstream. The latter tend to cross the boundaries between SENS strands. First, it is crucial to be able to measure efficacy across the full range of metabolic markers, and Horvath , Fortney , and Csordas will address three complementary \"omics\" domains in which changes with age - and therapeutic manipulations of those changes - can be monitored: epigenomics , metabolomics , and proteomics . Then we will hear, from Young and Zhavoronkov , how drugs can be discovered and repurposed using state-of-the-art computational techniques. Finally, how are therapeutics delivered? The conference\\'s closing session will feature Calos , Scholz, and Hebert telling us about new ways to get nucleic acids , proteins, and cells (respectively) into places that standard methods can only inadequately reach.', 'publish_date': '2017-12-25', 'title': 'Program and Speakers Announced for Undoing Aging, March 2018 in Berlin', 'url': 'https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2017/12/program-and-speakers-announced-for-undoing-aging-march-2018-in-berlin/', 'start_index': 875}, page_content='the size of the research community presently working on ways to repair the causes of aging.

In fact, the evidence for this to be the case had been compelling for a very long time - this demonstration came nearly a decade after Aubrey de Grey , on the basis of the existing evidence at the time, included cellular senescence as one of the causes of aging in the first published version of his SENS research proposals. Yet nothing had been done to move ahead and achieve something with this knowledge. That did not change until researchers obtained sufficient philanthropic funding to run the 2011 animal study, using a sophisticated genetic mechanism that eliminated senescent cells as they formed. From that point on, a slow-moving avalanche of interest and funding fell into this part of the field of aging research. All of the groups with an existing interest in cellular senescence, and that had previously struggled to raise sufficient resources to make progress, could now move rapidly. With the aim of selectively destroying senescent cells to reverse aspects of aging, small molecule senolytic pharmaceuticals and then other methods such as gene therapies and immunotherapies were discovered or constructed. Today there are at least a dozen such small molecule drugs, published and in the works, and a handful of increasingly well-funded startup biotech companies bringing these therapies to human trials and the clinic. That is the practical side that will lead to rejuvenation treatments in the near future. But the pure scientific impulse isn't to build new technology, it is to learn how our biochemistry works. Much of the funding for further work on cellular senescence goes towards mapping and understanding its details. Now that it is inarguable that this phenomenon is important in the progression of degenerative aging, scores of research groups are picking apart the biochemistry of senescent cells. They are categorizing, trying to understand whether all senescence is essentially the same, or whether there are significant differences in different cell types. They are attempting to better grasp all of the relevant mechanisms that operate inside cells as senescence occurs, and how the triggering change works - or, indeed, whether or not it is a single trigger. They are exploring the details of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) , the means by which these cells cause harm to tissues. The four open access papers noted here are recent examples of this sort of thing. There is a great deal to learn, and while the work is largely irrelevant to the senolytic therapies currently in development, there will no doubt be discoveries that steer and inform development of the second generation of more subtle and sophisticated therapies. Those will likely commence development five to ten years from now, and be mature and in widespread use by the early 2030s. TNFα-senescence initiates a STAT-dependent positive feedback loop, leading to a sustained interferon signature, DNA damage, and cytokine secretion Cellular senescence is a cell fate program that entails essentially irreversible proliferative arrest in response to damage signals. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) , an important pro-inflammatory cytokine secreted by some types of senescent cells, can induce senescence in mouse and human cells. However, downstream signaling pathways linking TNFα-related inflammation to senescence are not fully characterized. Using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as a model, we show that TNFα induces permanent growth arrest and increases p21CIP1 , p16INK4A , and SA-β-gal , accompanied by persistent DNA damage and ROS production. By gene expression profiling, we identified the crucial involvement of inflammatory and JAK/STAT pathways in TNFα-mediated senescence. We found that TNFα activates a STAT-dependent autocrine loop that sustains cytokine secretion and an interferon signature to lock cells into senescence. 3′ UTR lengthening as a novel mechanism in regulating cellular senescence Cellular senescence has been viewed as a tumor suppression mechanism and also as a contributor to individual aging. Widespread shortening of 3′ untranslated regions (3′ UTRs) in messenger RNAs (mRNAs) by alternative polyadenylation (APA) has recently been discovered in cancer cells. However, the role of APA in the process of cellular senescence remains elusive. Here, we found that hundreds of genes in senescent cells tended to use distal poly(A) (pA) sites , leading to a global lengthening of 3′ UTRs and reduced gene expression. Genes that harbor longer 3′ UTRs in senescent cells were enriched in senescence-related pathways. Rras2 , a member of the Ras superfamily that participates in multiple signal transduction pathways , preferred longer 3′ UTR usage and exhibited decreased expression in senescent cells. Depletion of Rras2 promoted senescence, while rescue of Rras2 reversed senescence-associated phenotypes . The SCN9A channel and plasma membrane depolarization promote cellular senescence through Rb pathway Oncogenic signals lead to premature senescence in normal human cells causing a proliferation arrest and the elimination of these defective cells by immune cells . Oncogene -induced senescence (OIS) prevents aberrant cell division and tumor initiation. In order to identify new regulators of OIS, we performed a loss-of-function genetic screen and identified that the loss of SCN9A allowed cells to escape from OIS. The expression of this sodium channel increased in senescent cells during OIS. This upregulation was mediated by NF-κB transcription factors , which are well-known regulators of senescence. Importantly, the induction of SCN9A by an oncogenic signal or by p53 activation led to plasma membrane depolarization, which in turn, was able to induce premature senescence. Computational and experimental analyses revealed that SCN9A and plasma membrane depolarization mediated the repression of mitotic genes through a calcium/ Rb / E2F pathway to promote senescence. Mitochondrial (Dys) Function in Inflammaging: Do MitomiRs Influence the Energetic, Oxidative, and Inflammatory Status of Senescent Cells? A relevant feature of aging is chronic low-grade inflammation, termed inflammaging , a key process promoting the development of all major age-related diseases. Senescent cells can acquire the senescence-associated (SA) secretory phenotype (SASP), characterized by the secretion of proinflammatory factors fuelling inflammaging. Cellular senescence is also accompanied by a deep reshaping of microRNA expression and by the modulation of mitochondrial activity , both master regulators of the SASP. Here, we synthesize novel findings regarding the role of mitochondria in the SASP and in the inflammaging process and propose a network linking nuclear -encoded SA-miRNAs to mitochondrial gene regulation and function in aging cells. In this conceptual structure, SA-miRNAs can translocate to mitochondria (SA-mitomiRs) and may affect the energetic, oxidative , and inflammatory status of senescent cells.\"}, page_content=\"senescent cells as they formed.

As is usually the case, the scientific section of the newsletter is also well worth reading. This time it is an examination of mitochondria and their role in aging: Question Of The Month #2: Aging and the Limits of Mitochondrial Restoration Q: Why can't fixing mitochondrial mutations and restoring peak ATP levels in the majority of cells in older people fix everything? I understand there are several classes of accumulated age-related damage like plaque build-up and glycation , which is why it seems like we'd need more than one approach to reverse aging, but if we give cells enough energy, could it be possible that all of it will just take care of itself? In other words, if cells once again have enough energy to perform their jobs to full capacity, couldn't they then carry out functions/mechanisms crucial to getting rid of all the age-related damage? I mean it sounds odd if you think of it using the car analogy: if you give an old car a new battery it's not going to fix other things like rust accumulation or leaky pipes... but because cells all work as a system, I think it's more likely that they'd be able to help control age-related accumulations. A: While mitochondrial DNA mutations are indeed important to address in the context of a comprehensive rejuvenation strategy like SENS , there are several reasons to think this alone would not be enough to deal with most other forms of aging damage. First, it's actually not all that clear that the mitochondria in the great majority of an aging person's cells actually suffer much decline in capacity to produce ATP . Certainly many older cells do suffer energy deficits, related to insulin resistance and/or secondary to other age-related metabolic (mal)adaptations - but those are causes unrelated to mitochondrial mutations. True, the cells whose mitochondria we're most concerned about suffer a pretty drastic reduction in energy production: those are cells that have been taken over by mitochondria harboring large deletions. But remember that such cells constitute a tiny percentage of the cells in the body. If the goal is simply to restore the capacity of the mitochondria in the majority of aging people's cells to produce ATP to levels similar to young people, we're already there. Also, while individual cells overtaken by mutant mitochondria certainly lack energy, such energy deficits don't do anything to hold back the great majority of the body's cells (since individual cells have their own mitochondrial power supply). Yet they still suffer aging damage. Furthermore, much aging damage accumulates because we lack the means to deal with it, meaning no amount of energy alone can prevent its accumulation. Third, a lot of aging damage is extracellular, and such damage can't really be addressed in most cases by cells. This is especially true in the case of damage to extracellular matrix ( glycation crosslinks and mechanical fatigue of arterial and other elastin lamellae , for instance), where typically there isn't even any ATP available, irrespective of a person's age. Fourth: remember, we were all young once. At that point, few or none of our cells had been taken over by mutant mitochondrial DNA, and yet even at that point in our lives we were aging. Indeed, this is true of the two examples you cite in your question: we are all born with at least some aging damage, such as fraying of arterial elastin and early atherosclerotic lesions . If youthful mitochondrial energetics were enough to abrogate the accumulation of aging damage, the degenerative process wouldn't get going until a substantial number of our cells were occupied by mutant mitochondria (which, again, arguably doesn't even happen when people reach what are today rather advanced ages). Most importantly: while it may one day be possible to begin administering rejuvenation therapies to people who are still in their youthful prime, at present we do not have the luxury to do this. Early recipients of rejuvenation biotechnologies will, by and large, be people whose bodies are already riddled with multiple kinds of cellular and molecular aging damage. Even if mitochondria capable of churning out ATP with the alacrity of Usain Bolt in his prime were enough to prevent other forms of aging damage from getting started (and again, the normal course of aging argues strongly otherwise), it seems far less plausible that it would be able to reverse the accumulation of aging lesions in people who have already been suffering such damage for six decades or more of life. In short: if we are to save the greatest possible number of people from the age-related slide into disease, disability, dependence, dementia, and eventual death, we are going to have to tackle the full spectrum of aging damage that has already riddled their bodies, and obviating mitochondrial mutations seems highly unlikely to achieve this key goal on its own.\"}, page_content='The SENS Research Foundation is one of the few scientific organizations energetically working on realistic approaches to human rejuvenation treatments, based on repair of the known cellular and molecular damage that causes aging .

The purpose of the SENS conference series, like all the SENS initiatives (such as the journal Rejuvenation Research ), is to expedite the development of truly effective therapies to postpone and treat human aging by tackling it as an engineering problem: not seeking elusive and probably illusory magic bullets, but instead enumerating the accumulating molecular and cellular changes that eventually kill us and identifying ways to repair - to reverse - those changes, rather than merely to slow down their further accumulation.

The program of presentations links to a range of interesting abstracts describing some of the important work that has taken place in the couple of years since SENS4, such as: Tissue engineering of the liver using decellularised scaffolds Here, we describe the fabrication of three-dimensional, naturally derived scaffolds with an intact vascular tree. ... The vascular network was used to reseed the scaffolds with human fetal liver and endothelial cells. These cells engrafted in their putative native locations within the decellularized organ and displayed typical endothelial, hepatic and biliary epithelial markers, thus creating a liver-like tissue in vitro . MitoSENS: Allotopic expression of mitochondrial genes using a co-translational import strategy The mitochondrion contains its own genome and encodes 13 proteins that are essential for the respiratory chain to function properly, [but] somatic mutations also accumulate in the mitochondria with normal aging. ... Thus far, we have stably transfected 5 of the 13 mitochondrial genes into the nuclear genome of human cell lines and are characterizing the expression and function of these exogenously expressed genes. I also note that the group in Florida who are running a trial of granulocyte transplant therapy for cancer - based on the impressive results achieved by Zheng Cui - will also be presenting. On the whole, the program is well worth browsing.

One aspect of the Foundation's outreach efforts is a growing YouTube video library of lectures and presentations by researchers in the field. A recent addition has Aubrey de Grey walking through the role of mitochondrial DNA damage , the present state of knowledge in the field, and what might be done to reverse this contribution to degenerative aging: In this video, SRF Chief Science Officer Dr. Aubrey de Grey discusses mitochondrial mutations, their role in aging, and the SENS approach to combating their deleterious effects. Dr. de Grey opens his lecture by describing the structure of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in humans. In particular, he explains that only thirteen protein-encoding mitochondrial genes actually reside in mitochondria . Throughout the course of human evolution, over a thousand other mitochondrial genes have migrated to the nuclear genome . Next, he explains the major theories developed between the 1970 and the present that aimed to explain the role of mtDNA mutations in aging. During his discussion of the most recent theoretical ground, Dr. de Grey explains his own contribution to the field : an alternative hypothesis to explain how clonal expansion of mutant mitochondria might occur. He then turns to therapeutic strategies and discusses the three main mechanisms by which scientists might intervene in mitochondrial aging. Dr. de Grey closes by describing the mechanism SRF finds most promising: inserting the thirteen protein-encoding mitochondrial genes into the nucleus modified in such a way that the corresponding RNA transcripts or protein-products can be imported into the mitochondria.\", 'title': 'Aubrey de Grey Explains the Role of Mitochondrial Mutations in Aging, and What to Do About It', 'publish_date': '2013-12-24', 'url': 'https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2013/12/aubrey-de-grey-explains-the-role-of-mitochondrial-mutations-in-aging-and-what-to-do-about-it/'}, page_content=\"The SENS Research Foundation (SRF) , cofounded by biogerontologist and advocate Aubrey de Grey , funds work on the foundation science needed for tomorrow's rejuvenation therapies.

Nonetheless, the study of cellular senescence used to be a comparative backwater in aging research, and as a topic it was mostly of interest to cancer researchers seeking ways to better shut down the replication of cancerous cells. But there is nothing quite like having a company raise $300 million in venture funding for rejuvenation therapies based on manipulation and destruction of senescent cells to bring a little excitement to this part of fundamental aging research. Who knows how many useful, exploitable mechanisms are yet to be found in senescent cells and the signals they generate? Each one is a potential lottery ticket for the discovering institution and research group. This was in fact always the case, and for decades a compelling set of evidence has strongly suggested that the accumulation of senescent cells is a significant contribution to aging. Yet next to no-one was funding or working on it seriously until the high-profile proof of concept study in mice reported in 2011, in which senescent cells were eliminated and health and life span improved as a consequence. After that point, the avalanche started, leading to today's crop of first generation senolytic therapies capable of selectively destroying a fraction of the senescent cells present in older individuals. Today I thought I'd point out a couple of examples of the sort of paper that results from an influx of funding and interest to the study of the fundamental biochemistry of senescent cells. The research community is mining for gold. The first explores the harmful signals secreted by senescent cells , the major way in which they cause tissue dysfunction in aging and age-related disease. A faction within the research community is more comfortable interfering in these signals rather than destroying senescent cells, despite it likely being a far worse and more challenging approach to therapy. The second paper is one of many in which researchers explore the role of mitochondrial activity in senescence, in search of approaches that might modulate the activity in beneficial ways. Both papers are quite different in focus, but they emerge from the same newfound interest in senescence as a cause of aging. Small extracellular vesicles and their miRNA cargo are anti-apoptotic members of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype Senescent cells lose their cell type specific functionality and replicative potential required for tissue regeneration and acquire a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) . The SASP is characterized by the secretion of growth factors , pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines , as well as extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling enzymes . These SASP factors are considered to over-proportionally exert negative effects on tissue homeostasis and regeneration in vivo if chronically present by acting in a paracrine manner on the neighboring cells and ECM. Attenuation of the negative effects of the SASP have been shown to restore the formation of functional human skin equivalents and has been suggested as a putative target in preventing age-associated diseases and frailty. Recently, extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their cargo have been reported to act in a similar manner as hormones or cytokines during intercellular communication. They are secreted by many, if not all cells, and by encapsulation of their cargo, they transport proteins, mRNAs , lipids , and non-coding RNAs , specifically miRNAs , over short or long distances. Thus, although many protein based SASP factors have been identified, miRNAs and EVs are under suspicion to be part of the SASP. However, a systematic catalogue of SASP-miRNAs has not yet been established and their selective secretion during senescence has not been studied so far. Here, we confirm that EVs and their miRNA cargo are indeed part of the SASP (EV-SASP) and identified a set of selectively retained and secreted miRNAs after the onset of senescence. In addition, senescent cell derived EVs might contribute to an anti- apoptotic environment in tissues where senescent cells have accumulated. Mitochondrial peptides modulate mitochondrial function during cellular senescence Mitochondria play important roles in cellular energy production, metabolism , and cellular signaling. These organelles have their own genomes , the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) . Epigenetic modification of mitochondrial DNA, including DNA methylation , is still controversial. The overall mitochondrial DNA methylation occurs at a lower frequency compared to nuclear DNA , but specific locations have been found to be differentially methylated in certain cellular conditions or in different biological samples. Humanin is a 24- amino acid peptide encoded within the mtDNA. It is secreted in response to cellular stress and has broad cytoprotective and neuroprotective effects. MOTS-c is a 16-amino acid peptide encoded within the mtDNA that improves metabolic functions. Among the basic processes that are known to drive aging phenotypes and pathology are genomic instability , epigenetic alterations, mitochondrial dysfunction , and cellular senescence. Although humanin and MOTS-c have protective roles in multiple age-associated diseases, the roles of these peptides in cellular senescence have not been explored. Senescent cells are metabolically active, producing energy-consuming effectors of senescence, despite the loss of proliferative activity. Depending on the inducer, senescent cells show higher levels of glycolysis , fatty acid oxidation , and mitochondrial respiration . Manipulating bioenergetic status can induce senescence and a SASP, suggesting that bioenergetics play a role in the senescence phenotype. Thus, altering the metabolic status of senescence cells may be an important strategy for eliminating the deleterious effects of senescence. In this study, we investigate mitochondrial energetics and mtDNA methylation in senescent cells, and evaluate the potential of humanin and MOTS-c as novel senolytics or SASP modulators that can alleviate symptoms of frailty and extend health span by targeting mitochondrial bioenergetics.\"}, page_content=\"compelling set of evidence has strongly suggested that the accumulation of senescent cells is a significant contribution to aging.

As you probably know, the SENS Research Foundation and a number of influential aging research institutions, such as the Buck Institute , are based in the Bay Area.

The Methuselah Fund is designed to accelerate results in the longevity field, extending the healthy human lifespan. They measure their success not just by financial return-on-investments but also by what they call return-on-mission. Their DNA stems from The Methuselah Foundation , which has been working hard during the last 18 years to make 90 the new 50 by 2030. Leucadia Therapeutics is determined to end Alzheimer\\'s disease with Arethusta, a first-in-class treatment for mild cognitive impairment associated with Alzheimer\\'s disease. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) clears toxic metabolites from intercellular spaces in the brain, much as the lymphatic system does in the rest of the body.  The first regions of the brain to be impacted by Alzheimer\\'s disease are cleared by CSF that drains across a porous bone called the cribriform plate . Aging and life events can occlude the cribriform plate and reduce the CSF-mediated clearance of toxic metabolites from those regions of the brain, thereby causing plaques and tangles formation. Leucadia\\'s patented Arethusta technology restores CSF flow across the cribriform plate, improving the clearance of toxic metabolites from the earliest regions of the brain to be affected by Alzheimer\\'s disease. Turn.bio develops a transient reprogramming protocol that has demonstrated a youthful reversion of eight of the nine hallmarks of aging . Reversion of the ninth is being currently being developed. They technology has already been proven to rejuvenate five different tissue types of the human body with more being evaluated. Osteoarthritis , skin damage, and sarcopenia are all proven targets of the technology, with other indications soon to be tested. Repair Biotechnologies is a longevity company with the mission to develop and bring to the clinic therapies that significantly improve human healthspan through targeting the causes of age-related diseases and aging itself. The company currently runs two preclinical development programs: the first for thymus regeneration and immune system restoration, and the second for reversal of atherosclerosis. Aikora Health and Foresight Institute joined forces to organize a series of talks on biotech investment and longevity. They gathered a curated group of entrepreneurs, scientists, and investors to discuss exciting projects that seek to extend human healthspan, surveying a diversity of novel approaches, and discussing which ambitious goals are realistically within our reach. Aikora Health connect investors with companies, founders and scientists in the health tech, genomics , and regenerative medicine sectors. Our key focus is on longevity tech with the potential to transform healthcare and human aging. We offer insight and information regarding the biotech and increasingly important longevity space, in addition to matching founders of biotech and longevity companies with funding and strategic partnerships.

This was a work of vision and synthesis: taking decades of research results from many diverse fields of medical research whose scientists had comparatively little contact with one another, and little interest in working on ways to treat aging, and pulling these results together into a convincing argument as to (a) which forms of cellular and molecular damage cause aging, and (b) how to go about developing the means of repair for this damage. Aging is damage, and repair is rejuvenation. Sufficiently comprehensive implementations of SENS should not only prevent aging and age-related disease, but also reverse the effects of aging in the old. This isn\\'t a matter of hand-waving: the capabilities in molecular biology and research plans to build therapies are outlined in considerable detail at the SENS Research Foundation website and in related scientific papers. You should take a look if you haven\\'t recently. The estimated cost of developing this to the point of demonstration in mice is on a par with the total cost of development of a single drug: perhaps $1-2 billion over 10-20 years . It is pleasing to chart the changing character of press coverage over the years for SENS rejuvenation research and its figurehead advocate and organizer Aubrey de Grey. In the past ten years of increasing support within the scientific community and an influx of millions of dollars in philanthropic funding for research, it has become ever harder for journalists to stick their heads in the sand and pretend that SENS is either fringe or not real science. The gatekeepers of the establishment are never kind to any form of change or progress in the early days. Measured by budget the SENS Research Foundation is a presently a tenth of the size of the well-established and mainstream Buck Institute for Aging Research . This is still larger than a good many labs in the field, and funding for SENS research has grown considerably over the past few years. Skilled molecular biologists in numerous laboratories are working on aspects of the SENS program of development for rejuvenation therapies. This work is still at the level of building tools and foundations for later progress but is very much real, tangible medical research. This is a new and upcoming field, the future of medical science and aging. Aubrey de Grey: Out to Defy Death Spend a moment asking yourself, \"What is the world\\'s worst problem?\" Biomedical gerontologist Aubrey de Grey, Ph.D., has an answer that may be radically different from yours. For him, it\\'s aging, and he not only makes a convincing case for why this is so , but he\\'s devoting his life to doing something about it. Dr. de Grey is the founder of SENS, a research foundation that aims to help build the regenerative medicine industry, an industry that arguably has the best chance for curing the diseases of aging. Surprisingly, he\\'s having more success than the people who were calling him a maverick and a heretic five years ago ever imagined. First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win. To my eyes things have made it to the early stages of the winning part of that saying these days, certainly insofar as the scientific community is concerned. ( Much more remains to be done in order to sell the public on the idea that radical life extension is a real possibility and that the relevant research is important and should be supported). SENS is far more than Aubrey de Grey nowadays: it\\'s his vision, but has grown to be shared quite widely. There are dozens of influential allied scientists and laboratories, a number of high net worth philanthropists providing support, many advocates, a SENS Research Foundation staff, fundraisers, and of course the numerous researchers working to build the tools needed for future rejuvenation treatments. The SENS Foundation is a public charity based in California, and its purpose is to fill a niche in the research funding chain. Private sector research, particularly in the drug industry, has funds to drive important research, but only after it\\'s clear that the odds of success are good, the time frame is reasonably short, and the potential for profit large. At the other end of the research spectrum, public sector research funding is available for basic research that doesn\\'t have an immediate commercial purpose. However, in Dr. de Grey\\'s view, and his colleagues as well, there\\'s a midway point between the private sector funding and the public sector, and this midpoint is often neglected.

Both were mocked by the mainstream media, marginal areas of human endeavor out on the fringes of society, supported by very little funding and a handful of dedicated supporters. Yet in both cases, compelling research existed to support the goals - of the treatment of aging, of reversible cryopreservation - and was largely ignored, or even actively derided by the academic mainstream, worried about appearances. A great deal has changed since then for the field of rejuvenation research. In the early 2000s, patient advocates were delighted and surprised by the rare occasion on which a six or seven figure check arrived from a philanthropist . It didn't happen often! Twenty years down the line, however, and billions in funding from philanthropists, research institutions, and venture funds are now devoted to the development of in vivo epigenetic reprogramming as an approach to the treatment of aging. Similarly, hundreds of millions have been invested in the development of senolytic therapies to clear senescent cells . The treatment of aging as a medical condition and the goal of reversal of aging is no longer mocked, it is taken seriously, and both funding and the number of ventures are increasing at a rapid pace. How did this change happen? It was a mix of networking, advocacy, philanthropy, and compelling advances in the science, such as the development of the first senolytics and many consequent studies showing rapid, profound rejuvenation in mice. A tipping point was reached after years of a long, slow grind of bootstrapping: a little more progress, a little more support, a little more progress. Once past that tipping point, matters moved much more rapidly year after year, and the acceleration continues today. I recently attended the 50th anniversary conference for the Alcor Life Extension Foundation , celebrating the lengthy run of one of the oldest cryonics providers. A good deal of the discussion there orbited around the usual questions asked by a small and passionate community: how does the cryonics field become larger, more robust? How does it achieve greater funding and faster progress towards widespread use? Fifty years on from the very early days of improvised equipment, ad hoc science, and regulatory opposition, the field of cryonics now looks a lot like the field of rejuvenation biotechnology did fifteen or twenty years ago. Slow progress is underway, the organizations are far more professional, and a few visionary philanthropists are putting in six or seven figure checks occasionally . Compelling advances in research exist, and are not receiving the widespread attention that they deserve. New organizations for advocacy and research are being founded with small budgets and big visions. Some of the technology waiting in the wings, such as reversible vitrification of human organs, may help to reach the tipping point once they are fully realized and in widespread use. Given this, I would not be surprised to see the cryonics field becoming much larger and more commercial, growing suddenly and rapidly, in the mid-to-late 2030s. By that time, I would expect that reversible vitrification of organs will be a going concern, radically changing the economics and viability of organ donation, and adopted as a core enabling technology by the new industry focused on manufacturing patient-matched organs to order. The widespread recognition of this technological capability will bring many more people to the realization that cryopreservation on clinical death is a viable approach to saving lives that would otherwise be lost, and matters will proceed ever more rapidly from there on.\", 'start_index': 875, 'publish_date': '2022-06-13'}, page_content='Twenty years down the line, however, and billions in funding from philanthropists, research institutions, and venture funds are now devoted to the development of in vivo epigenetic reprogramming as an approach to the treatment of aging.

As was the case last year , once again Fight Aging! and a few fellow travelers will assemble a challenge fund to encourage new SENS Patrons to set up subscriptions to make monthly or yearly recurring donations to the SENS Research Foundation. The first year of any such new donations will be matched dollar for dollar from the challenge fund. We think that recurring donations are important: the more that our community supports the SENS programs by providing a regular supply of funding, the easier it becomes for the SENS Research Foundation staff to plan ahead and commit to long-term projects. In past years this initiative has been a success: our matching fund was met last year, and the new monthly donors largely stick around for the long term to continue to support SENS rejuvenation research . This year regular donor Josh Triplett is going above and beyond to put up $36,000 to encourage new SENS Patrons to make the leap. Christophe and Dominique Cornuejols are contributing $12,000, and I myself will put in $6,000. We are looking for other challenge fund donors to join us in this initiative. Do you want to make a sizable difference to the future of human health and longevity? This is how it is done. The SENS Research Foundation uses our donations to fund a range of scientific work on the foundations of rejuvenation therapies, focused on those areas that are furthest behind or that most need unblocking in order to achieve meaningful progress. These are all programs that achieve rejuvenation through repair: validating the list of cell and tissue damage that lies at the roots of aging, and then reversing these forms of damage, one by one. It is in large part thanks to the advocacy, networking, and funding provided by the SENS Research Foundation, and by the Methuselah Foundation before it, that rejuvenation research is as far ahead as it is. When the SENS programs started, popular culture and the scientific community were opposed to any initiative aiming to produce rejuvenation via targeting the molecular damage that causes aging, despite decades of evidence to strongly support this strategy. In recent years the naysayers have been proven clearly and categorically wrong. Clearance of senescent cells through the use of senolytic therapies has been shown to produce rejuvenation in mice. The first such treatments are in human trials, in development by multiple biotech companies, and being used by a growing number of self-experimenters worldwide. That today there is a new and rapidly growing senolytics industry, poised to deploy rejuvenation therapies that can remove some of the burden of senescent cells in older individuals, is due in large part to the network of advocacy, science, and funding centered on the SENS Research Foundation and Methuselah Foundation.

Senolytics are just the start. They are only a part of the story, and only a narrow slice of the complete human rejuvenation that remains only a possibility, rather than a certainty. Scores of other equally important and beneficial projects under the SENS umbrella of repair therapies are still comparatively neglected, or blocked by the lack of tools, or blocked by the lack of funding, or lacking strong champions in the research community. We can help to change this. We did a great deal to make that change come about for senescent cell clearance, and we can do the same for mitochondrial DNA repair , for breaking the cross-links that stiffen tissues , for clearing amyloids and other harmful metabolic wastes , and more. We shine the light that shows the way, and, given time and resources, we are successful. Give some thought to joining us.

These companies are all quite young, focused on various means of selectively destroying the senescent cells that accumulate with age. Animal data from mice shows that these cells are an important contributing cause of aging and age-related disease , as clearing them reverses the progression many aspects of aging and age-related diseases, while also extending life span. Senescent cells exhibit the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) , producing a mix of molecules that provoke chronic inflammation and tissue dysfunction. The biochemistry of senescence is, so far as the research community has determined to date, very similar in all its important aspects in mice and humans. It is thus hoped that senolytic therapies will be the first rejuvenation treatments worthy of title. Unity Biotechnology is way ahead of the pack: No other company is in the clinic (though Mayo Clinic has a Dasatinib + Quercetin Phase 2 trial ). Unity has already completed a Phase 2 (UBX0101, failed) and they are currently conducting a new Phase 1 (UBX1325). But first is not always best - Unity's approach is somewhat crude compared to the targeted approaches of newer senolytics companies. But perhaps it will be enough. More senolytic trials are coming: Unity won't be alone in the clinical stage for long. I believe that FoxBio , Senolytic Therapeutics , Numeric Biotech , and Rubedo Life Science will be in the clinic within 12 - 24 months. 1st Gen vs 2nd Gen: Dasatinib , Navitoclax , UBX0101 were 1st generation senolytics developed by hypothesis: That existing drugs that targeted anti- apoptotic pathways might also clear senescent cells. Unfortunately, many of these 1st gen drugs have off-target effects that kill non-senescent cells, too. Now it appears the majority of the industry is focusing on 2nd generation therapies through high-throughput screens to improve selectivity. Novel targeted modalities (peptides, monoclonal antibodies , gene therapy , immunotherapy , RNA ) and delivery ( nanoparticles and conjugate prodrugs ) are being developed as well. Unity Biotechnology is the only senolytics company to go public so far. However, Juvenescence is planning to go public within ~6 months, at which point you will be able to own a slice of FoxBio. The current market is amenable to IPOs so I wouldn't be surprised if another senolytics company went public just before their Phase 1 trials - perhaps in the next two to three years, should markets hold up. The majority of companies are focussing on killing senescent cells with senolytics. However, four companies have senomorphic pipelines (Senolytic Therapeutics, Senisca , Atropos Therapeutics , Dorian Therapeutics ). I'm excited to see which approach will prove most effective, though I am less sanguine on the clinical prospects of approaches that merely slow senescence. Would a second Unity Biotechnology failure have an impact on the future of senolytics? Yes and no. Unity is just one of many companies developing senolytics and their current clinical trials are only testing the earliest senolytic strategy (1st gen). There are many more senolytics companies aiming for clinical trials in the next two years and some will be testing 2nd generation targeted therapies. If UBX1325 were to fail in Phase 2 the immediate effect would be a decrease in unsophisticated capital in the senolytics space - from those who don't understand the other promising targets and modalities in development. This might be a notable amount of money in the short term but long term I am optimistic about senolytics. All it takes is one success for the floodgates to open.

SENS, the Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence , is both (a) a laundry list of forms of cell and tissue damage that cause aging, with supporting evidence from the past century of scientific research into aging, and (b) a laundry list methods of intervention that should produce rejuvenation. Aging is damage accumulation, and rejuvenation is repair of that damage. Funding for SENS programs, and initiatives to produce therapies based on the SENS view of damage repair, remain as relevant as ever. In fact, even more relevant now than was the case in the early 2000s, given the extensive evidence gathered over the past decade to support the SENS view on the role of senescent cells in aging . The view that accumulation of senescent cells is an important aspect of aging, and a viable point of intervention for the first rejuvenation therapies worthy of the name, was first published by Aubrey de Grey and others in an academic paper in 2002 , well in advance of the 2011 technology demonstration of senescent cell clearance that convinced enough of the research community for further exploration to be prioritized. Today, twenty years after the first call to action, and ten years after the first compelling demonstration, many biotech companies are working on the development of therapies to selectively destroy or modulate the behavior of senescent cells, scores of animal studies show reversal of measures of age-related disease following partial clearance of senescent cells in old mice, human clinical trials are underway, and countless research groups are investigating the biology of senescent cells, in search of new approaches to achieve these goals. Senescent cells are just one of the seven categories of cell and tissue damage outlined in the SENS proposals for a rejuvenation biotechnology industry. The SENS Research Foundation and its allied researchers and spin-out companies remain necessary: the success achieved in turning senescent cell clearance from a compelling idea to (almost) a clinical reality must be repeated, and repeated many times, if we are to achieve the goal of cures for age-related disease, prevention of frailty , sickness, and death in the old, elimination of the largest cause of suffering and mortality in the human condition. 2022 Annual Report Like so much in our modern world, curing the diseases of aging is a collaborative effort. In 2021, SENS Research Foundation (SRF) found itself at the center of a brand new way to fundraise. The ingenuity and generosity of Richard Heart , and the willingness to envision a life free from age-related disease from a forward-thinking global community, provided SRF with unprecedented resources. We gained not only in dollars, but also in number of supporters. Our vision struck a chord that reverberated across a broader group of people than ever before. Our mission inspired so many to put their trust and resources behind us, and we could not be more grateful or more determined to honor their support through the acceleration and expansion of our vital research. At the same time, we had a changing of the guard at SRF. Undergoing internal investigations in the public eye, under intense scrutiny. Saying goodbye to our visionary founder, to a full half of our Board of Directors, and to our long-time Director of Education. Within the last year, SRF has seen more upheaval, more incredible support, and more intense criticism, than in the entirety of the previous decade. And yet we remain, passionately in pursuit of the mission that drove our founding. Our dedication to making the \\'Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence\\' a life-saving reality is rock-solid, as we hope this Annual Report will make clear. Our mission is vital; one hundred thousand people die every day of age-related disease. Millions more suffer due to age- related decline and disability. Our mission cannot be side-tracked, cannot be delayed, and must take precedence over all other concerns. Last year was difficult, but also empowering. Our leadership may change, but our founding vision is powerful and keeps us focused on the path ahead. Our mission is our defining priority. Together, we will build this new world, one brick at a time. 2022 Research Report Catalytic Antibodies Targeting Intracellular Tau Oligomers Therapeutic interventions with anti- tau immunotherapies have shown promise, but the efficacy seems to vary greatly. The tau LysoSENS group at SENS Research Foundation is investigating the therapeutic potential of catabodies ( catalytic antibodies ) targeted to the intracellular compartment to degrade tau aggregates and prevent or reverse tau-associated neurodegeneration . Unlike conventional binding antibodies, catabodies bind transiently to their targets and hydrolyze them into very small hydrolytic end-products, leaving the catabody free to attack the next target molecule. Rejuvenating Immune Surveillance of Senescent Cells Natural Killer (NK) cells are a known key immune cell type responsible for the immune-mediated senolysis of senescent cell s. Moreover, NK cells are increasingly emerging as an important defense against several age-related diseases, the best-understood example of which is cancer. However, NK cell function declines as part of immunosenescence , and this likely includes immune surveillance of senescent cells, leaving the host increasingly vulnerable to diseases of aging, as recently reviewed in a paper published by the Sharma lab at SENS Research Foundation. To understand the potential of NK cell transplantation as an immunosenolytic therapy, the ApoptoSENS team is collaborating with the Campisi lab at the Buck Institute to investigate the effect of aging on NK cell cytotoxicity toward senescent cells. Studies will test the ability of young vs. old donor derived NK cells to remove senescent cells in a mouse model. Additionally, the Sharma lab is in the process of developing CAR ( Chimeric Antigen Receptor )-NK cells with enhanced ability to target senescent cells for adoptive cell therapy, and the above studies will be repeated using CAR-NK cells. Studying age-related changes in the immune cells has led the ApoptoSENS team to discover a sub-population of T-cells that declines with age. Analysis indicates that these \"X cells\" constitute only approximately 5% of total peripheral blood mononuclear cells , so in order to investigate their interaction with senescent cells, the team established a protocol for enrichment of X cells in culture. These experiments indicated that X cells rapidly kill senescent cells. Based on these promising initial results, Sharma and coworkers are now further assessing the therapeutic potential of this sub- population of T cells, as they appear to be highly selective in eliminating senescent cells in a substantially shorter time than has been reported by others or observed in their own prior work with NK cells. Engineering New Mitochondrial Genes to Restore Mitochondrial Function The MitoSENS lab at SENS Research Foundation, led by Dr. Amutha Boominathan, is working to develop rejuvenation biotechnologies to repair or obviate the accumulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations with age. Their principal focus is allotopic expression (AE) , in which copies of the protein-encoding mtDNA genes are placed in the nucleus , with suitable modifications to allow them to be expressed in the nucleus and translated in the cytosol , following which they must be imported into the mitochondria. There, these gene copies can incorporate into the relevant electron transport chain complexes and contribute to sustaining oxidative phosphorylation . This would allow mitochondria to continue producing ATP , irrespective of the accumulation of particular mtDNA mutations. Boominathan and colleagues implemented that strategy in the past to synthesize 2 versions of the 13 mtDNA genes: a) the minimally recoded version that is absolutely required for productive protein translation in the cytosol and b) the codon-optimized version, synchronizing the codon usage in these genes to the mammalian nuclear code. They were able to successfully demonstrate robust transient protein production and mitochondrial association for all the 13 mtDNA genes using the codon-optimized gene expression constructs. Cytosolic protein expression under transient expression was substantially higher for the codon-optimized than for minimally-recoded genes, and similarly for steady-state mRNA levels under stable selection. Eight of the re-engineered genes retained expression and targeting to the organelle after stable selection. Building on these early observations, the team validated the utility of these codon-optimized mtDNA gene constructs for additional mitochondrial protein targets that did not work in the past. The mitochondrial DNA deletions that accumulate in aging cells have a strong selection advantage, amplifying within post-mitotic cells to the point of homoplasmy . The MitoSENS team is exploring a strategy to address this issue by transferring exogenous, viable mitochondria modified for sustained retention and for therapeutic activity. While mitochondrial transplantation is already being investigated by several groups and companies as a therapeutic intervention strategy, Dr. Boominathan\\'s team is advancing an improvement on this strategy using mitochondria with genomes engineered for dominance over the native genotype. Target Prioritization of Extracellular Matrix Aging As we age, changes occur not only in the cells within the extracellular matrix (ECM) , but importantly also in the composition and chemistry of the ECM. Many of the characteristic physical changes that we associate with ageing, such as the changes in skin appearance or the decrease in flexibility of joints, are specifically the result of changes in the structure and composition of the ECM. Two important components of the ECM are elastin and collagen ; indeed, collagen is estimated to account for about 30% of the protein in the body. The Clarke lab is investigating age-related changes in the chemical structure of elastin and collagen and how these changes impact the mechanical behavior of the tissues. Prior to Clark\\'s investigations, the general consensus in the literature was that tendon increases in stiffness with age and that this was due to an increase in crosslinking between collagen molecules. His group has instead found was that it is not possible to say that tendon gets stiffer with age, particularly when comparing mature to genuinely aged animal tissue. Instead, Clark and colleagues report an increase in the breaking strain, a decrease in the ability to absorb stress, and an increase in the fragility (chance of rupture) with age. This is clearly a more refined and complex description of the physical properties, and accords better with the orthopedic vulnerabilities of aging human tissues. Clarke\\'s research has also revealed an increase in irreversible crosslinks in the tendon with age, which increase the force required to break a tendon. This increase occurs even as the tendon gradually becomes depleted of reversible crosslinks that allow the tendon to adapt to and absorb force. Understanding how each of these different crosslinks affect the mechanical properties of a tissue and how they change in number with age will enable more targeted strategies for rejuvenation biotechnologies. Based their findings, Clarke and colleagues predict that to rejuvenate youthful tendon function would entail decreasing the number of irreversible crosslinks while greatly increasing the reversible crosslinks. Conceptually, this could be achieved through various means, some of which might not involve directly targeting the crosslinks themselves, but instead cell therapy or other approaches that rejuvenate the behavior of the cells that turn over the ECM. In principle, an unbalanced approach based exclusively on breaking a subset of crosslinks might improve some aspects of tissue function but also cause structural problems. Lipofuscin Degradation by Bacterial Hydrolases According to the \" garbage catastrophe theory of aging \", the accumulation of lipofuscin aggregates limits the remaining life span of the organism by disturbing lysosomal function and inducing cell death. While humans have no enzymes capable of breaking down lipofuscin, microorganisms possess a wide array of enzymes that allow the degradation of any conceivable molecule formed in nature. Thus, the LysoSENS strategy seeks to identify microbes that are able to degrade lipofuscin via specific hydrolases as lead candidates for potential longevity therapeutics. To pursue this goal, the Grune lab will use authentic lipofuscin derived from human cardiac tissue. Dr. Grune and colleagues extracted microorganisms from different soil samples collected at a residential yard, a forest, a compost heap, and a riverbed. The team used these extracts to select lipofuscin-degrading bacteria by growing cultures on isolated lipofuscin as the only energy, carbon, and sulphur source. Following 20 sets of sub-culture passaging , bacterial mixtures growing on human tissue-derived lipofuscin were extracted, and 12 bacterial strains were isolated. These strains and their specific enzymes will be isolated and further investigated. It bears noting that it is not expected that these bacterial enzymes will prove to be proteases , but hydrolases able to degrade complex crosslinks between proteins. This fact will complicate the identification of lead candidates, but on the other hand, such structures will be unique to lipofuscin and able to function in mammalian cells (after suitable modification) without the danger of digesting functional proteins. A future task will be the targeting of the identified hydrolases towards the lysosomal compartment. SenoStem: Combinatorial Rejuvenation Biotechnologies Age-related disease and disability results from the complex interaction of multiple forms of cellular and molecular aging damage . Prominent examples of this damage are the loss of stem cells and the accumulation of senescent cells. Senescent cells propagate damage and impose systemic metabolic derangement through the secretion of a senescence-associated secretory profile (SASP) . The SenoStem project at SENS Research Foundation is testing the hypothesis that combination therapy using senolytics and stem cell transplantation will have a synergistic beneficial effect on aging mice and might be able to further improve health and lifespan - literally a remove-and-replace strategy. This approach builds toward SRF\\'s larger long-term goal to develop synergistic combinatorial rejuvenation biotechnology approaches. Microglia as a Vehicle for Brain Rejuvenation With SRF funding, the Hébert team has developed a protocol for using microglia as a delivery system for biologics over wide areas of the adult brain. With this protocol, endogenous microglia are replaced with transplanted microglia after a single superficial cell injection. Microglia are migratorily more active compared to neuronal progenitors and more easily spread throughout the brain. In addition to therapeutic proteins, this system can be used to deliver new neurons to all areas of the brain to counteract neuronal loss with age. The transplanted microglia can be engineered to produce a secreted biologic, or engineered to be reprogrammed to new neurons. In both cases, normal microglia density is innately re-established, minimizing any effect of transient microglia depletion while providing novel therapeutic support to brain function. Identification and Targeting of Noncanonical Death Resistant Cells It is well established that senescent cells (SCs) can result from a number of stressors, including replicative stress, telomere erosion and damage, and oncogene expression. They are also induced as part of tissue remodeling in wound healing and development. More recently, it was discovered that SCs can spread the senescent phenotype to other cells in the body. Characterization of secondary SCs and differentiating their biology and vulnerabilities from those of primary SCs is thus critical to developing longevity therapeutics targeting the full spectrum of senescence in aging, and is the central focus of Dr. Admasu\\'s work at SENS Research Foundation. With his SRF colleagues, Dr. Adamasu developed a novel protocol to overcome one major roadblock in this endeavor, which has allowed him to make new insights into secondary senescence and identify a highly significant therapeutic target for senolytic drugs with broad senolytic activity against both primary and secondary SCs.', 'url': 'https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2022/09/sens-research-foundation-annual-reports-for-2022/', 'publish_date': '2022-09-14', 'title': 'SENS Research Foundation Annual Reports for 2022'}, page_content='clinical trials are underway, and countless research groups are investigating the biology of senescent cells, in search of new approaches to achieve these goals.

In 2021, SENS Research Foundation (SRF) found itself at the center of a brand new way to fundraise.

Whether this heralds a sweeping change in the way in which the world views aging is anyone\\'s guess, but the existence of major investment and sizable companies working on therapies for aging does serve to make it increasingly challenging to be a naysayer on the topic of extended healthy longevity without appearing foolish. Osteoarthritis is the first disease Unity Biotechnology is tackling, and that one disease represents a huge opportunity: By 2026, the market for osteoarthritis drugs will be $2.6 billion in the U.S. alone. The company is currently in a phase 1, government-approved safety trial with about 40 patients in multiple sites across the U.S. The goal is to show that the drug Unity is developing - what\\'s called a senolytic agent - can be injected into the knee and tolerated by patients in gradually higher doses. Ultimately, the thinking is that such a drug can destroy senescent cells, effectively halting or reversing osteoarthritis in the knee. In the future the same drug might be effective in treating pain elsewhere in the body. \"Osteoarthritis standard of care begins with ibuprofen , then steroids , and then most people\\'s standard of care is just accepting it: you\\'re old, that sucks, and you\\'re now in pain for the rest of your life. But we think there\\'s a better way, by looking through the lens of biological insight of why those diseases happen in the first place.\" Over the last decade the titans of the tech industry have dedicated money toward cutting-edge research focused on curing disease as well as slowing, delaying and, possibly one day, reversing the conditions of old age. Perhaps the most visible example is Calico, short for the California Life Company , a spin-out from Google launched in 2013 and funded with $1.5 billion to study the causes of aging and what to do about them. \"People in Silicon Valley look at problems as solvable, with enough time and enough steps. And, obviously, the size of the return is huge. If you\\'re able to bring anything like that to the market, you have something that\\'s universally needed. Senescent cells are really one of the first bona fide targets of aging that we\\'ve found we\\'ve been able to do something about.\" Taking aim at senescent cells is a treatment paradigm being used not only by Unity Biotechnology, but also by research hospitals in the U.S. A team at the Kogod Center on Aging at the Mayo Clinic is currently testing the use of senolytic drugs in treating chronic kidney disease in humans . \"The time has finally arrived that our knowledge of biology and our sophistication level is sufficient that we can attack some of these fundamental, underlying causes of aging.\" Link: https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/29/jeff-bezos-backs-silicon-valley-scientist-working-on-a-cure-for-aging.html', 'url': 'https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2018/08/articles-on-senolytics-are-starting-to-look-just-like-articles-on-any-other-field-of-medical-research-and-development/', 'title': 'Articles on Senolytics are Starting to Look Just Like Articles on any Other Field of Medical Research and Development', 'start_index': 120, 'publish_date': '2018-08-31'}, page_content=\"It is probably worthy of note that press articles on the treatment of aging via senolytic therapies are becoming similar in tone and content to press articles on any other active field of medical development.

These organizations are undertaking seed research, engaging in persistent advocacy, and organizing conferences to steer the scientific and funding communities onto the best paths to produce the toolkit of therapies and biotechnologies needed to achieve human rejuvenation. This means building ways to repair the catalog of cell and tissue damage that causes age-related fraity and disease, and thus reverse its progression. The goal is old age without pain, without suffering, without any loss of health and vigor, and given the right strategies in research and development, this is a practical goal for the decades ahead. The SENS Research Foundation has a tiny budget for an organization that seeks to profoundly change the world for the better: entirely funded by philanthropic donations at $5 million each year. It is never the intent that the SRF staff and associated researchers do everything themselves, however. The point of the exercise is to steer other funds and other scientific groups towards the best possible lines of research by demonstrating their worth, and by making sure that everyone in the scientific community knows about past demonstrations carried out elsewhere. Does this really work at this sort of funding level, however? The answer is a resounding hell yes it works, even if more is always better. If you have been paying attention for the past decade you\\'ll notice that these days there are several lines of SENS research that are spreading out and being picked up by people with deeper pockets. Senescent cell clearance has had its arrival year this year, with a great technology demonstration of improved healthspan in aging mice . Similar the targeting of telomere extension as the common mechanism in all cancer is a SENS approach that now has some people in the mainstream research community working on a variety of initiatives , while the SENS Research Foundation in-house efforts are respectfully covered by the popular science media . Ten years ago, the people who publicly proposed exactly this research were mocked, and all too many scientists avoided talking about extending healthy human life by treating the causes of aging. Now it is a very different story. All those community fundraisers in the past, all of the advocacy, all of the grassroots efforts? They pay off. Not immediately, because it takes years to make things happen. But we can clearly see the results arriving now. There are yet more areas of SENS research that need to have their day in the sun, however, which is why we must double down and keep on trucking. We\\'re starting to win the game in earnest, the wheel is moving, the avalanche started, so why stop here? The SENS Research Foundation in fact probably gets more media attention than your average non-profit of its size, and justifiably so. Nowhere near enough media attention, I\\'d say. Research into repairing the causes of aging needs to be right up there in the public conversation alongside cancer research, and the funding should be much the same. That is a thing to aim for, and the sooner we get there the better the prospects for a future that doesn\\'t involve sickness and decline. Here are a couple of recent items covering the SENS Research Foundation and its staff: New innovation to extend life expectancy Tucked away in a small office in the heart of Silicon Valley, the SENS research foundation is engaged in the cutting-edge work of rejuvenation biotechnology. They experiment with preservation of the cell and, more specifically, the powerhouse of the cell: the mitochondria . With donations primarily from philanthropists, SENS operates on a US$5million annual budget that founders consider a drop in the bucket compared to what is spent on healthcare. SENS\\'s approach is still a long away from being used on people, as it would likely need testing on animals first before being incorporated in human gene therapy, a technique also still under study. Front and Center: Singer, Composer, Pilot, Global Outreach Coordinator at SENS Research Foundation, Maria Entraigues-Abramson WiMN: You\\'re currently the Global Outreach Coordinator for SENS Research Foundation. How has your experience as a singer and composer helped you with this role? MEA: As you can probably tell I can\\'t stay on just one thing. I\\'ve always had this unstoppable curiosity since I was a little girl, and science has been one of my other big passions. SENS Research Foundation is a non-profit organization located in the Bay Area, working to develop new therapies to prevent, reverse and eradicate the diseases of aging. As we age we accumulate damage at a cellular and molecular level , that happens since we are born. This damage or \"junk\" as we call it, doesn\\'t bother us much until we start getting older. When the amount of waste crosses a certain threshold it starts affecting the functions in our body and we get sick. If we live long enough, in the way medicine is today, we will get at least one age related disease (cancer, Alzheimer\\'s , cardiovascular disease , Parkinson\\'s , etc) if not several, and if we don\\'t die of something else before, this is what will eventually kill us. At SRF we have a roadmap to get aging under medical control. These strategies (Strategies Engineered for Negligible Senescence) were designed by biogerontologist Dr. Aubrey de Grey , a very prominent scientist from Cambridge, U.K., who co-founded the organization and is our Chief Science Officer. He wrote the book Ending Aging where he explains the seven types of damage that make us age and how we can tackle them using regenerative medicine. This is what we work on. My work as the Global Outreach Coordinator is mainly development and fund raising. I focus on creating new relationships, bringing high net worth Individuals onboard. I do celebrity outreach, organize events, and anything that will help create awareness and raise funds to push the research and the development of treatments forward. These cures will happen, it is just a matter of time, and the more funding we get the faster it will happen.

It is never the'), Document(metadata={'body': \"Reforming and rebuilding an entire field of medical research and development isn't an easy task, and sadly nor is it something that can be achieved overnight. A comprehensive reformation of the aging research community is nonetheless the goal of the SENS initiative, the Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence - a way to build rejuvenation therapies that work by repairing forms of cell and tissue damage that cause aging. SENS came into being precisely because aging research was not heading in the right direction: researchers were not attempting to treat aging as a medical condition, influential figures were in fact actively suppressing any sort of impetus in that direction , and where there were glimmerings of hope in the form of a few scientists interested in intervening in the aging process, these individuals were focused on strategies that could not possibly do more than slightly slow down age-related degeneration. Over the past fifteen years SENS has progressed from a position statement and a vision for the end of aging, a set of ideas and supporting evidence only, to a modestly sized set of research programs that are now producing results, several non-profit foundations, a web of relationships with a outsized influence on the research community , and the clinical development of the first rejuvenation therapies . SENS has come a long way from the first meetings of a few like-minded researchers and advocates, just after the turn of the century. Now many researchers are openly talking about the causes of aging and the construction of therapies to meaningfully treat aging. The old suppression of this topic has crumbled entirely. It remains the case that most researchers are still stubbornly pursuing approaches that cannot have a large effect on human health and life span , but the initial battle to change the direction of the research community has been fought and won. Now it is just an increasingly vocal and public debate over how best to proceed, and here SENS will win in time as therapies that repair age-related molecular damage are proven to be far cheaper, more effective, and more reliable than other efforts. We have come a long way, but one of the necessary parts of advocacy that I think that our community does poorly is the presentation of this growth and success of past years. There is so much we can point to, and show where and how we came together to make a difference, to change the course of research, to fund and build new advances, to change minds and gather allies. We don't do a good job when it comes to clearly showing the progression from (1) initial idea to (2) non-profit scientific foundations to (3) philanthropic support of research to (4) broader research community participation to (5) proof of concept technology demonstrations to (6) founding of biotechnology companies to (7) venture fundraising to (8) clinical trials of rejuvenation therapies. That long chain now exists nearly end to end for senescent cell clearance as a rejuvenation treatment , and all of the other potential branches of SENS research are underway in some form. So with that in mind, the following timeline references some of the important developments and advances in rejuvenation biotechnology since the origin of the SENS program, from the slow and incremental start to the present more rapid pace. It is by design a high-level and sparse overview, as I wanted to capture the bigger picture without getting dragged down into the details. Watching early stage progress in research from year to year can be a frustrating process, but as senescent cell clearance demonstrates, once a field reaches the tipping point of viability and support, things then move very rapidly. Further, given that this all started with a few ideas and a little persuasion, it is certainly the case that mountains have been moved over the years, even if it feels all too slow on a day to day basis. There is much more to be done ahead, but all who have participated in the past should feel rightfully proud of what has been accomplished, and what continues to be accomplished today. 2002 The first of Aubrey de Grey's collaborative papers , describing SENS as a goal-driven approach to the treatment of aging as a medical condition, is published in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences. 2003 The Methuselah Foundation is created, and the founders launch the Mprize for longevity science, a research prize aiming to spur greater interest in extending healthy life spans. The first SENS-focused academic conference is held in the UK under the auspices of the International Association of Biomedical Gerontology. 2004 The Methuselah Foundation begins to assemble the 300 , a core group of donors who go on to be influential in the course of advocacy and development of rejuvenation biotechnology. Their funds power the early work of the foundation, and some start their own initiatives in later years. 2005 An individual whose identity remains a mystery to this day makes a $1 million donation to the Methuselah Foundation to expand the Mprize purse. The Methuselah Foundation begins funding (a) LysoSENS research , searching for enzymes in soil bacteria capable of consuming age-related metabolic waste, and (b) allotopic expression of mitochondrial genes , aiming to remove the consequences of mitochondrial damage in aging. The Methuselah Foundation sponsors the Supercentenarian Research Foundation , supporting a program of autopsies of supercentenarians. Over the next few years this demonstrates transthyretin amyloidosis to be the majority cause of death . 2006 Peter Thiel publicly supports SENS research with a $3.5M grant. Researchers first demonstrate the creation of induced pluripotent stem cells , a foundation for much of the future of regenerative medicine to replace cells lost to aging . 2008 The Methuselah Foundation expands allotopic expression funding to support a French research group that will go on to establish Gensight Biologics on the strength of this work. The foundation also announces the commencement of research initiatives for most of the other SENS programs: clearing senescent cells, removing metabolic waste such as amyloid and cross-links, and investigation of alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) in the context of cancer. The first US SENS conference is held at UCLA . 2009 The SENS Research Foundation spins off from the Methuselah Foundation to focus entirely on SENS rejuvenation research. GSK and Pentraxin Therapeutics begin a collaboration to develop a therapy capable of clearing transthyretin amyloid. The Methuselah Foundation makes its first outside investment in the Organovo tissue printing startup. 2010 The SENS Research Foundation's yearly budget reaches $1 million. The foundation sets up a laboratory facility in Mountain View, California for ongoing intramural research projects . Jason Hope pledges $500,000 to the SENS Research Foundation to start a research program aimed at developing a viable cross-link breaker for glucosepane in humans. Researchers find that transplanting a young thymus into an old mouse restores immune function and extends life. 2011 Aubrey de Grey devotes the majority of his $16.5M net worth to funding SENS research. The SENS Research Foundation is funding either in-house or external research projects in all of the seven strands of SENS rejuvenation research. Some are very early stage, focused on building tools or discovery, while others are building the basis for therapies. The first demonstration of targeted senescent cell clearance is carried out by an independent research group, producing benefits in mice with an accelerated aging condition. The Methuselah Foundation launches the New Organ tissue engineering initiative. 2012 Gensight Biologics is founded to commercialize allotopic expression of mitochondrial gene ND4, based on the research program supported initially by the Methuselah Foundation, and later the SENS Research Foundation. The SENS Research Foundation demonstrates bacterial enzymes that can break down 7-ketocholesterol in cell culture . Methuselah Foundation supported tissue printing company Organovo becomes publicly traded on NASDAQ. Covalent Bioscience is founded to advance work on catalytic antibodies (or catabodies) to clear the amyloid associated with Alzheimer's disease. 2013 Gensight Biologics raises a $32M series A round. The Methuselah Foundation announces a $1 million research prize for liver tissue engineering as a part of the New Organ initiative. This year the foundation also sponsors organ banking initiatives at the Organ Preservation Alliance . The important Hallmarks of Aging position paper is published , the authors taking a cue from the SENS rejuvenation research proposals, but carving out their own view on damage and repair. Google Ventures launches Calico , adding a great deal of support to aging research with the size and publicity of the investment. Unfortunately Calico goes on to focus on areas of aging research unrelated to rejuvenation. Cenexys is founded to work on the creation of means to selectively destroy senescent cells in aged tissues. 2014 The Methuselah Foundation and SENS Research Foundation provide seed funding to launch Oisin Biotechnologies, to develop a method of targeted clearance of senescent cells. The SENS Research Foundation begins the Rejuvenation Biotechnology conference series , bringing together industry and academia to smooth the path for development of rejuvenation therapies. Following the Hallmarks of Aging, leading researchers publish their Seven Pillars of Aging position, again echoing the long-standing SENS view of aging and its treatment. The SENS Research Foundation funds development of catabodies to break down transthyretin amyloid , and the work shows considerable promise. Human Rejuvenation Technologies is founded to commercialize a treatment for atherosclerosis based on SENS Research Foundation LysoSENS program approaches to clearing metabolic waste compounds. 2015 The SENS Research Foundation's yearly budget reaches $5 million. The Spiegel Lab at Yale announces a method of creating glucosepane , a vital and to this point missing tool needed to develop glucosepane cross-link breaker drugs. This work was funded by the SENS Research Foundation. A research team demonstrates the first senolytic drug candidates capable of selectively destroying senescent cells. The number of candidate drugs increases quite quickly after this point. Pentraxin Therapeutics announces positive results in a trial of targeted clearance of transthyretin amyloid . Meanwhile, evidence continues to emerge from other groups for transthyretin amyloid to have more of an impact in age-related disease that previously thought. SENS Research Foundation work on sabotaging ALT to suppress cancer receives more attention . Meanwhile progress is reported on the other half of telomere extension blockade, interfering in the operation of telomerase, an area in which a number of groups are participating. The Methuselah Foundation makes a founding investment in Leucadia Therapeutics in order to pursue a novel approach to the effective treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The research program producing catabodies capable of breaking down transthyretin amyloid is transferred to Covalent Bioscience for clinical development. 2016 Ichor Therapeutics begins commercial development of a method of clearing metabolic waste from the retina, based on technology developed in the SENS Research Foundation LysoSENS program. Gensight Biologics demonstrates success in a trial of mitochondrial allotopic expression of ND4 as a way to treat inherited mutations of that gene. The underlying technology is proven. SENS Research Foundation scientists, meanwhile, successfully demonstrate allotopic expression of  ATP6 and ATP8 . After more than a decade of high profile failures, amyloid-β is finally cleared from the brain in a small human study using an immunotherapy approach. The SENS Research Foundation crowdfunds a drug discovery program to find candidates that can interfere in ALT, and thus suppress the telomere elongation that cancer depends upon. Cenexys is reformed as Unity Biotechnology with a focus on senolytic drugs. The researchers involved show that clearance of senescent cells in normal mice produces 25% extension of median life span. Later in 2016, the company raises $116M in venture funding. Other work on removal of senescent cells across the year shows restoration of function in aged lung tissue , and improved vascular health . New evidence reinforces the role of senescent cells in osteoarthritis , as well as in atherosclerosis , immunosenescence , and diabetic retinopathy The Methuselah Foundation launches a $500,000 research prize for tissue engineering in collaboration with NASA. Michael Greve pledges $10M to fund SENS research and startup biotechnology companies that emerge from that research. 2017, so far... There are now nearing ten different senolytic drug candidates with openly published evidence, and more in the pipeline. Oisin Biotechnologies announces that their senescent cell clearance technology can also be applied to cancerous cells , reporting successful animal studies for tumor ablation. Methuselah Foundation launches the Methuselah Fund to shepherd more rejuvenation-related biotechnology startups towards success.\", 'url': 'https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2017/06/progress-in-sens-rejuvenation-research-over-the-past-15-years/', 'publish_date': '2017-06-30', 'start_index': 861, 'title': 'Progress in SENS Rejuvenation Research Over the Past 15 Years'}, page_content='aging process, these individuals were focused on strategies that could not possibly do more than slightly slow down age-related degeneration.

All the Best, David Gobel Dear Supporters, At SENS Research Foundation, our CSO Team is a full time, internal research team that supports Aubrey de Grey in the work of keeping up-to-date on the most cutting edge science in rejuvenation biotechnology. Michael Rae, Ben Zealley, and Maximus Peto spend many, many hours reviewing the science literature, analyzing new papers, reporting on their findings, and offering suggestions for research priorities for SRF. We are delighted to draw on that work in partnership with Methuselah Foundation, to provide the members of its MF 300 with this newsletter highlighting a handful of the most notable scientific articles and advances, and some of the insights inspired by those advances. Best, Mike Kope The Methuselah Foundation is thrilled to partner with SENS Research Foundation in order to bring out the most recent advancements in tissue engineering, regeneration, and rejuvenation research for members of The 300. It doesn\\'t take a scientist to understand the vital importance of investing in healthy life extension, so our newsletters will frame these developments as accessibly and approachably as possible. We\\'ll focus on the relevance of three recent studies (within the past 3-6 months) and describe how each one fits into the broader landscape of longevity research. This first edition of what will hopefully be a regular feature offers commentary on the following papers, and as you can see once you start to delve into the details very little is clear cut. It is rarely easy to see after only a few months whether new and interesting research will turn out to be game-changing, irrelevant, or merely the foundation of an incrementally better treatment that reaches clinical availability five to ten years from now. The forest of science has very thick undergrowth indeed. You might look back in the Fight Aging! archives to see references to the work on GDF-11 and the C1q paper . I am nowhere near as cautious in my expectations as an actual researcher in the field, and you should bear that in mind: note the differences between my comments and those of the SENS Research Foundation folk. Growth Differentiation Factor 11 Is a Circulating Factor that Reverses Age-Related Cardiac Hypertrophy These results are exciting, but further testing is needed, and there is good reason to be cautious. First, the observation that GDF-11 usually declines with age suggests that the real problem to be addressed is whatever causes its decline in aging. Second, GDF-11 is known to inhibit neurogenesis , and therefore human supplementation with this protein may cause problems. As with any therapeutic, adequate testing will need to be done to ensure safety and efficacy in humans. A final noteworthy aspect of this study is that GDF-11 was able to reverse cardiac hypertrophy in \"wild-type\" (non-mutant) mice. A great many studies in aging research use mutant mice to model diseases of aging, and most humans do not have single-gene mutations that cause age-related disease. Thus, research on wild-type mice may more accurately model human diseases associated with advanced age, and lead to more promising therapeutic strategies. Therapeutic and preventive effects of methylene blue on Alzheimer\\'s disease pathology in a transgenic mouse model There has been considerable interest in the use of MB as a treatment for human brain diseases in which proteins form toxic aggregates, such as Alzheimer\\'s disease , > Parkinson\\'s Disease , and \" tauopathies ,\" wherein mutant forms of the protein Tau aggregate. Aggregation and accumulation of substances in body tissues, particularly the brain, is also a theme in research on aging. The mechanism of MB\\'s potentially beneficial effects on AD is not known, but it has been speculated to act by assisting the function of mitochondria in the brain. Declining mitochondrial function is another phenomenon which may be associated with diseases of aging, and is an active topic in rejuvenation biotechnology research. It\\'s also important to be aware of the possibility that MB may not represent a cure for AD. It may turn out to be a treatment whose beneficial effects would wear off if it were discontinued, particularly if it functions via mitochondrial antioxidant activity. A Dramatic Increase of C1q Protein in the CNS during Normal Aging We find it important to always be careful when considering whether some scientific observation is a cause or a consequence of aging. The present paper, with its notable 300-fold increase in C1q , can easily tempt one to conclude: \"high levels of C1q need to be removed.\" This may be the case, but not necessarily. Before coming to this kind of conclusion, we strive to ask questions such as: \"Is there some aspect of the immune system , related to C1q, which is recruited more highly in aging? If we ameliorate this activation of the immune system, will C1q levels no longer rise so much?\" Finally, the authors noted that while mouse C1q was ~300 fold higher in aging, it was only 8-fold higher in human brains: a noteworthy difference. We hope that further experiments will answer these questions, and others, to inform us about the exact role of C1q in aging dysfunction.', 'publish_date': '2014-01-30'}, page_content=\"between the Methuselah Foundation and SENS Research Foundation to publicize some of the more interesting and relevant research recently uncovered: Rejuvenation Biotechnology Update Dear Friends, As one of The 300, your loyal support of the Methuselah Foundation make up the backbone of our mission.

We don't want that to happen here, as it means the difference between health or frailty, life or death for all of us. The first in a series of Rejuvenation Biotechnology conferences organized by the SENS Research Foundation was held late last year, and by all accounts went very well. You should certainly take a look at the BioWatch News special issue devoted to the conference and its goals if you have not already done so. It is a thoughtful look at some of the issues facing research and development in those parts of the field of aging research focused on intervention and cures. The aim of the Rejuvenation Biotechnology conference series is to lay the groundwork for closer collaboration between industry and research establishments in the development of near future therapies to treat degenerative aging. The scientific foundations needed for rejuvenation therapies are progressing at a pace that is far slower than we'd all like, but it is nonetheless time to prepare the way for clinical translation of research results. That process takes time, and to pick one example, initial attempts at clearance of senescent cells might be only a few years away from initial clinical trials at this point: a for-profit startup company was recently founded to work on one approach. While it is easy to imagine that any practical treatment for aging would be mobbed by developers seeking to bring it to market as soon as it makes it out of early stage research, in truth that sort of outcome only happens when sufficient preparation has taken place. That means at the very minimum building a network of relationships and knowledge. Videos of presentations given at the Rejuvenation Biotechnology conference were recently posted by the SENS Research Foundation staff. I think you'll find them interesting. Many more than are shown here can be found at the SENS Research Foundation YouTube channel . The Rejuvenation of Aged Skeletal Muscle by Systematic Factors The primary research focus of the Jang laboratory is to understand the molecular and biochemical mechanisms of age-related muscle loss and function. The Jang laboratory applies bioengineering approaches and stem cell-based therapies to study skeletal muscle dysfunction during aging and in age-associated muscle diseases. The laboratory develops and applies novel tools using a combination of animal and stem cell models. A Twist of Fate - Generating New Neocortical Neurons The line of investigation aims to establish ways of regenerating the principle neurons of the adult cerebral cortex when these neurons are lost due to trauma or degeneration, including degeneration due to aging. Since endogenous precursors do not replace cortical neurons when they are lost, two strategies are being developed: manipulating these precursors with molecular genetic techniques to start generating neurons and transplanting engineered precursors that are programmed to disperse in the cortex and differentiate into cortical projection neurons. Building a Rejuvenation Biotechnology Industry - Panel Discussion This panel synthesized the discussions from all of the conference sessions and panels. A cross-section of academics, pharmaceutical reps, policy makers, and other presenters revisited the merits of a damage repair paradigm to address the diseases of aging considered at this conference. Panelists considered the changes that would be required to lay the groundwork for a new industry perspective focused on addressing damage indications for the diseases of aging either through preventing or repairing such damage.\", 'url': 'https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2015/02/presentation-videos-from-rejuvenation-biotechnology-2014/', 'title': 'Presentation Videos from Rejuvenation Biotechnology 2014', 'publish_date': '2015-02-25', 'start_index': 59}, page_content=\"Ours is an era on the verge of developing means to treat the root causes of degenerative aging and thereby extend healthy life, eliminate age-related disease, and rejuvenate the old.

The Foundation is perhaps the only organization in the world today that is organizing and funding serious scientific work on prevention and reversal of aging . Near every other funding organization and research group aiming to intervene in the aging process, and there are far too few of those by the way, are working on the foundation of ways to slow aging , not halt it or reverse it. Unfortunately this is the wrong path to produce results in the near term. Think in terms of metal machinery failing due to rust: the slow aging crowd wants to build an machine that rusts more slowly by altering the properties of its component parts and the metals it is made of. The prevention and reversal approach, by comparison aims at removing rust and rust-proofing - which is a much easier path, focusing on a much less complex and far better understood problem space. To return to our biology, the rust in this analogy corresponds to the small number of types of fundamental damage to cells and molecular machinery that accumulate as a result of the ordinary operation of metabolism. The slow aging crowd are looking into the very expensive process of learning enough about altering the way in which our metabolism works in order to slow down the pace of damage. The research community has barely started on establishing the knowledge needed to do this, and even getting to the present point has required years and billions of dollars. There will be decades and tens of billions ahead before any sort of meaningful result will emerge, and even when it does it will be of no use to old people. What help is slowing down damage when you are already so damaged that you are close to death? In comparison to metabolism, the rust - the cellular and molecular damage that causes aging - is simple. The results are only complicated because we are complicated. Further, these forms of damage are comparatively well understood and enumerated. The research community knows enough to be able to propose detailed research plans leading to repair therapies. That is far more than can be done for ways to slow aging. Repair is the better path, more cost-effective, and the end goal far more effective for patients, and yet so very few groups are working on it. This is why our support for the SENS Research Foundation is very important. Their work must receive enough  funding to demonstrate its worth beyond any doubt and thus be adopted by all those other groups presently working on the slow road to nowhere. On to the newsletter, which notes that the Foundation will be a sponsor for the forthcoming World Stem Cell Summit . You might recall that last year\\'s meeting was where the Methuselah Foundation announced the New Organ Liver Prize . SENS Research Foundation is proud to be a Bronze Level Sponsor of this year\\'s World Stem Cell Summit. The World Stem Cell Summit is the largest global meeting of stem cell science and regenerative medicine stakeholders. Attendees enjoy unequaled opportunities for networking, collaboration, new partnerships, and shaping the future of this\\nrapidly advancing field. The WSCS will be held December 3-5, 2014, at the Marriott RiverCenter, San Antonio, TX, USA. SRF CSO Dr. Aubrey de Grey will be moderating a panel at the conference. As always the question of the month section is well worth reading. One of the present themes of the Foundation\\'s work, illustrated by the recent Rejuvenation Biotechnology 2014 conference , is establishing the necessary relationships between research and industry that will enable a smooth transition from lab to clinic of the first prototype treatments for the causes of aging. It takes years to lay groundwork, so best to start now. Question of the Month #6: Meeting The Challenges of the Regulatory Maze and Getting Rejuvenation Biotech Into the Clinic Q: In response to a previous question of the month, you explained why the fact that \"aging\" is not recognized as a \"disease\" for which the FDA and other regulatory bodies license therapies should not actually pose a significant hurdle to getting rejuvenation biotechnologies licensed and into widespread use. But there was a lot of discussion at the recent Rejuvenation Biotechnology 2014 Conference about the challenges to rejuvenation biotechnology posed by current regulatory structures and some gestures toward what might be needed to advance the science into the clinic. Would you spell those out? A: Rejuvenation biotechnologies are a new approach to preventing and treating the diseases and disabilities of aging, based on the repair and maintenance of the cellular and molecular structures that become damaged over time. Degenerative aging processes occur all across our bodies as this damage accumulates in particular tissues; the \"diseases\" that emerge in our bodies late in life are simply the recognizable impairment of organ-specific function resulting from the gradual build-up of this damage. This approach is so new that it is not very well-served by current regulatory structures, which mostly assume the presence of an existing disease, and that drugs will either alleviate current symptoms, or will intervene in metabolic pathways that perpetuate aspects of abnormal function without having any effect on the underlying damage that causes it. Several regulatory changes would help to bring rejuvenation biotechnologies into clinical trials and then into widespread use. One is to reverse the sequence in which rejuvenation biotechnologies are tested. First, there are several states of ill health driven by the degenerative aging process that are clearly extremely disabling and deadly, but that are not yet recognized as \"diseases\" by the FDA . The most glaring of these is sarcopenia (or, some have argued, \" dynapenia \"): the age-related loss of muscular strength that results from the combination of loss of muscle mass, and the degradation of the cellular and molecular integrity of what muscle remains. Sarcopenia is highly disabling, restricts people\\'s ability to take care of themselves, increases the risk of accidents and fractures, and is strongly linked to increased risk of death - but it is not yet a licensed \"disease\" indication. Fortunately, the FDA seems to be open to the idea of developing a new indication for therapies that combat sarcopenia, and several pharmaceutical companies are working in the field. There have now been several scientific conferences and high-level summit meetings in which senior FDA officials, sarcopenia researchers, and major pharmaceutical companies have worked toward defining diagnostic criteria and suitable outcomes for licensing anti-sarcopenia drugs. The sooner they succeed, the better. Second: today, new drugs are usually first tested in patients with existing disease. Regulatory approval depends on the drug showing a clear impact on clearly-defined, hard clinical outcomes such as heart attacks or progression to dialysis. Over time, many therapies initially approved on this basis later come to be used in a more preventive approach in high-risk patients without overt disease, through a mixture of informal practice and clinical trials. This occurred, for example, with statins , antihypertensives , and antidiabetics . Unfortunately, this progression begins to yield useful data too late in the pathological process to optimally test rejuvenation biotechnologies. Our goal is to develop therapies that will keep people\\'s tissues sufficiently healthy and functional that such late-stage pathologies do not occur. Thus, we will want to test these therapies in patients not yet exhibiting overt disease, with minimal or no symptoms and no near-term risk of death or disability from the disease. Instead, it would be preferable for regulators to accept the removal, repair, or replacement of cellular and molecular damage itself as an initial goal of clinical trials. The prevention of particular diseases\\' emergence would then be incorporated in a kind of \"conditional licensing\" a longer-term goal, perhaps to be monitored in a robust system of postmarket surveillance. This, again, reverses the usual practice in today\\'s regulatory system, where the endpoint is initially a catastrophic patient outcome such as heart attack or stroke , and only later are surrogate outcomes on mediating metabolic factors (such as lowering LDL cholesterol or blood glucose ) accepted. Finally, it would be of tremendous benefit to test rejuvenation biotechnologies in combination with each other from the outset. The normal approval path for a candidate drug entails that it first be tested for effectiveness and safety on its own, or as an add-on to drugs that are already the standard of care. But many specific, diagnosed diseases of aging are actually the clustering together of several forms of aging damage in one or more tissues. Additionally, it is often the case (as with the beta-amyloid protein and aberrant tau species in Alzheimer\\'s disease ) that the contributing kinds of aging damage are intertwined with one another in complex causal chains. In such cases, the removal of only one form of aging damage may not be enough to demonstrate a positive effect on tissue function or disease-related outcomes. If researchers are forced to test individual rejuvenation therapies that each remove only one of these contributing forms of damage in isolation, they may well fail to show any meaningful effect, and be kept out of the hands of doctors and patients - even though they would have indefinitely postponed the disease if tested together. This potential dilemma could be resolved if complementary rejuvenation biotechnologies - each targeting one of the key lesions driving such a disease state - could be tested in combination from the outset, following the collection of basic safety data, without first having to prove their individual effectiveness in averting catastrophic outcomes. All of these moves are dramatic departures from the ways that medical therapies are currently tested, approved, and regulated for use. Fortunately, substantial moves in these directions are already afoot in the testing of rejuvenation biotechnologies for Alzheimer\\'s disease and other neurological disorders. We believe that these moves can be supported and normalized, and then used as a template for the testing of rejuvenation biotechnologies generally.'}, page_content='rapidly advancing field.

You can find it in PDF format at the foundation website . The story of SENS rejuvenation research , approaches that aim to repair the cell and tissue damage that causes aging , is one of growth and success over the years . It has been a bootstrapping from idea to reality, powered by the philanthropy and determined support of our community. We have come a long way and achieved a great deal these past fifteen years. Yet there remains the upward curve ahead, and the completion of the vision of an end to aging has yet to be accomplished. It is true that the first SENS therapies are on the way to the clinic, their commercial development funded by venture capital now, and senescent cell clearance is at the front of the pack. But equally important approaches to removing the damage that causes aging, such as the breaking of glucosepane cross-links , are still in the laboratory, still entirely funded by charitable donations, still building the infrastructure and running the tests in search of the first potential basis for a working therapy. When that first breakthrough is made, matters speed up considerable and funding comes running from many sources - but getting there is a slow grind. The more we can do to help the SENS Research Foundation thrive, the faster they can push forward with this stage of development: planting the seeds that will blossom into vast medical industries, and in doing so bring great benefit to humanity. SENS Research Foundation 2016 Annual Report (PDF) Since SENS Research Foundation\\'s founding in 2009, we\\'ve worked toward bringing our vision of a world free of age-related disease from concept to reality. In challenging ourselves on this front, we have likewise challenged you, our supporters. We\\'ve asked a lot of all of you, and not only have you accepted this challenge, you have delivered. The rejuvenation biotechnology community that has emerged over the past several years owes its existence to each and every one of you. You have become our most vocal advocates. Over 2000 of you have become our funders . We asked you to help us change how the world researches and treats age- related disease. You did. Through the efforts of our donors, collaborators, and our advisory board, world-renowned institutions are pursuing age- related disease research specifically focused on the damage-repair paradigm. We asked you to help us move from basic research to translational research and clinical trials. You did. In 2016 we launched Project|21 , our five-year plan to help move rejuvenation biotechnologies from concept to human clinical trials. Project|21 is now backed by a number of generous and forward-thinking individuals. You asked us to follow through. We did. In lending your support, you place not only resources in our hands, but trust. We know that a world-changing nonprofit cannot operate on the power of vision alone; and we are here not just to inspire, but to deliver results. The purpose of this report is to demonstrate concrete examples of those results to you. With your help, we have taken great steps toward the establishment of a robust rejuvenation biotechnology industry and the realization of our vision. And every step we are able to take is proof of the power of your community. Death-Resistant Cells: Toward Neutralizing the SASP Buck Institute researchers led by Dr. Judith Campisi had shown that the presence of senescent cells alongside cancer cells can stimulate those cells to both multiply more rapidly and to spread to other parts of the body - the metastasis process, which ultimately makes most cancers so deadly. Repeating these studies in cell culture while inhibiting the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) with apigenin almost completely nullified the proliferation-stimulating and pro-metastatic effects of senescent cells on breast cancer cells. Drugs based on parts of apigenin\\'s structure could dampen some of the harmful effects the SASP in senescent cells. Removing these cells is the ultimate solution to these problems, and in the last year several groups have made rapid progress toward this goal. In the meantime, these studies using apigenin may demonstrate important principles from which senescent-cell-focused rejuvenation biotechnologies may be derived. Target Prioritization of Tissue Crosslinking Our arteries slowly stiffen with age, in substantial part because of random crosslinking of the structural proteins collagen and elastin . Developing rejuvenation biotechnologies to break these crosslinks is key to restoring youthful arterial function. To tease out the effects and relative importance of all of these different sources of crosslinking in aging tissues, the Babraham Institute team has been studying the crosslinking process in the tissues of aging mice. This has required the development and validation of new experimental methods and assays , which are now ready for use. The team has evaluated multiple tissues for crosslink presence. Importantly, some of the crosslinks that have been reported by others to accumulate in aging tissues were not detected. While further studies are needed to confirm it decisively, these results suggest that several crosslinks now believed to accumulate in aging tissues may actually be experimental artifacts. Engineering New Mitochondrial Genes to Restore Mitochondrial Function Free radicals derived from our energy-producing mitochondria can mutate the organelle\\'s DNA , leading to deletions of large stretches of the mitochondrial genome . These deletion mutations prevent the mitochondria from building various pieces of the electron transport chain (ETC) , with which mitochondria generate most cellular energy. The accumulation of deletion-mutation-containing cells is a significant consequence of aging. A potential rejuvenation biotechnology to recover ETC function is the allotopic expression of functional mitochondrial genes: placing \"backup copies\" of all of the protein-coding genes of the mitochondria in the \"safe harbor\" of the nucleus , thereby giving the mitochondrion all of the proteins it needs to continue producing energy normally even when the original mitochondrial copies have been mutated. This year, the SRF MitoSENS team reported a tremendous success: for what they believe is the first time, they have used allotopic expression to rescue the complete loss of a mitochondrially-encoded protein in a mammalian cell. A publication announced their success in the fall of 2016. The results show that their targeted and recoded ATP8 protein can be expressed from the nucleus, turned into protein in both normal and mutant cells, and efficiently targeted to the mitochondria. Furthermore, they can demonstrate functional rescue of cells. Under conditions where mutant cells die for lack of ability to produce energy, the cells with engineered allotopically-expressed proteins were able to survive and replicate. In addition to ATP8, the SRF MitoSENS team has further demonstrated expression and targeting of a second re-engineered protein, ATP6 . It is proof-of-concept that ATP8 is not a special case. Identification of the Genetic Basis of ALT in Cancer Telomeres shorten every time a cell divides, and thus all cancers have to find a way to keep their telomeres long enough to prevent senescence or death. Most cancers use an enzyme called telomerase for this purpose, but about 10-15% of cancers use a telomerase-independent mechanism known as Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) . The ALT mechanism remains largely a mystery, and therefore the OncoSENS team at SENS Research Foundation is working hard to find new ways to attack ALT cancers. First, the team has developed and established two separate high-throughput assays measuring different ALT-specific biomarkers . These assays will finally enable cancer researchers to screen hundreds of thousands of compounds across multiple drug libraries, or even test every single one of the more than 20,000 genes in the human genome , for ways to shut down ALT cancers. In addition to their biomarker work, the team is also pursuing more targeted methods to kill ALT cancer cells. Glucosepane Crosslinks and Routes to Cleavage One major cause of crosslink accumulation in aging is Advanced Glycation Endproducts (AGE) , and one AGE in particular, called glucosepane , is currently thought to be the single largest contributor to tissue AGE crosslinking. The Yale AGE team is studying the role of AGEs in aging, and developing novel tools and strategies for reversing AGE-mediated protein damage and develop new antibodies and reagents to enable rejuvenation research. Our pilot lab at Cambridge University found that all of the commercially-available antibodies for the major AGE-related molecules are actually highly unreliable. This is a serious impediment. The Yale glucosepane team is now tackling this problem via the novel chemistry and methods they have developed. In the last twelve months, the Yale team has made exciting progress in their work. Most notably, they have developed the first synthetic route to produce glucosepane . Their novel synthetic strategy is the first ever to provide high yields of pure samples of glucosepane, putting them (and soon other scientists) for the first time in a position to explore mechanisms through which crosslinks can be broken. In collaboration with a colleague at Yale, they have also developed a high-throughput assay for screening proprietary libraries of organic catalysts for agents capable of breaking synthetic glucosepane. One of these libraries has already been taken forward for proof of concept, which led to the identification of several leads for catalysts that could be capable of breaking glucosepane. Beyond that, the Yale group has successfully generated proteins containing their synthetic glucosepane that can be used to identify antibodies that label glucosepane-containing proteins. These antibodies will enable the immunochemical detection of glucosepane crosslinks for a wide range of applications. Tissue-Engineered Thymus The thymus gland is responsible for the development of a class of immune cells called T-cells . As part of the degenerative aging process, the thymus shrinks in size . This process of thymic atrophy prevents the body from maturing new T-cells, progressively weakening the immune system\\'s ability to fight off never-before-encountered infections. Engineering new, healthy thymic tissue would help to restore the vigorous immune response of youth. SENS Research Foundation has therefore funded a Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine (WFIRM) group to apply tissue engineering techniques to the creation of functional thymic tissue to fortify or replace the aging thymus. Engineering new tissues requires a \"scaffold\" in which to embed cells to give them structure and functional cues, and the WFIRM group has tested different scaffolding systems: decellularized donor scaffolds and hydrogels . In the decellularized scaffold paradigm, an organ of the type that is needed is taken from a donor, but is then stripped of its original cells and DNA, leaving behind a protein structure with low potential for immunological rejection that can be repopulated with cells taken from the new organ recipient. The WFIRM group initially began work in this paradigm using mouse organs, but they found that once decellularized, mouse thymuses lacked the rigidity to serve in that role. They accordingly moved on to the pig thymus - a species that not only worked well as an experimental system, but has some clinical potential as well. The pig is closer to humans both immunologically and in terms of size. Catalytic Antibodies Targeting Transthyretin Amyloid As part of the degenerative aging process, proteins that normally remain dissolved in bodily fluids become damaged, and adopt a misfolded form called amyloid . Amyloid composed of the transporter protein transthyretin (TTR) deposits in the heart and other organs with age, beginning to impair heart function. With SRF funding, the University of Texas-Houston Medical School (UTHMS) extracellular aggregate team is working to develop novel catalytic antibodies (\"catabodies\") that would recognize and cleave TTR amyloid deposited in the heart and other tissues. Catabodies have the potential to be safer and more effective than conventional antibody -based immunotherapies : their catalytic activity minimizes the amount of antibody required to clear deposits from tissues, and the fact that they don\\'t form stable complexes with their targets or engage immune cells is expected to minimize the inflammatory side-effects seen with other experimental antibody therapies. Work has resulted in the identification of two powerful TTR-cleaving catabodies. When tested for their ability to degrade misfolded wild-type TTR, these candidates were able to hydrolyze both soluble aggregates and deposit-like particulates, while having no effect on either TTR in its healthy, normal conformation or on a selection of fourteen other physiologically important proteins. Concentrations required to disintegrate 80% of a sample of amyloid were many hundreds of times lower than those routinely achieved in the blood using other infused antibodies. The establishment of stable cell lines will enable larger-scale production, as the team works to develop these candidates into functional rejuvenation biotechnologies. Rejuvenation of the Systemic Environment There might be a misunderstanding of what was really going on in parabiosis . When animals are connected, they are not just given reciprocal blood transfusions, but are surgically joined together. So in addition to receiving young blood, the old animals also have their old blood filtered through the young animals\\' livers and kidneys, and diluted with the young pairmate\\'s own blood. Might the effects of parabiosis mostly come from the removal of toxic or suppressive factors from the old animals\\' sluggish circulation instead of from the delivery of active rejuvenating factors? To test this possibility - and to accelerate identification and testing of potential pro- and anti-rejuvenation factors in the exchanged blood - SENS Research Foundation funded Dr. Conboy and the UC Berkeley systemic environment team\\'s development of a novel technological platform. Using a mixture of off-the-shelf and custom 3-D printed parts, this platform enables the group to easily and safely extract blood from small animals and transfuse it quickly and directly into another animal, without the reciprocal exchange of its blood or the passage of its blood through the pairmate\\'s system. It thus separates the effects of the young animals\\' metabolic and excretory systems from the pure effects of their blood. The team then used the new system to repeat key parabiosis experiments from Dr. Conboy\\'s and others\\' labs. As compared with the impact of full-on parabiosis, the effects of isolated young blood on old muscles\\' ability to repair an injury were still substantial: the stem cells recovered significant regenerative powers, and less residual fibrosis remained after the wound was resolved. But by contrast, previously-reported benefits of parabiosis in the brain and the liver were either not present, or were far more modest. Another critical finding was the confirmation of suppressive factors in the old animals\\' blood, which inhibited neurogenesis and other regenerative responses of young animals transfused with it. While this clearer picture of the basis of the \"parabiosis effect\" indicates a lower likelihood of isolating true pro-rejuvenation factors in the blood of young mice, we are nonetheless closer to being able to filter out factors responsible for suppressing the regenerative potential of an older body. Commercial Development Two of the companies SENS Research Foundation has supported are moving to raise funding to move their research from the lab to clinical trials. Ichor Therapeutics announced a Series A offering to bring its Lysoclear product for age-related macular degeneration and Stargardt\\'s macular degeneration through Phase I clinical trials. In 2014, Ichor Therapeutics completed a material and technology transfer agreement for rights to concepts and research pioneered by SENS Research Foundation. Lysoclear, which Ichor announced in 2017, is a recombinant enzyme product based on extending SRF\\'s prior work that selectively localizes to the lysosomes of retinal pigment epithelium cells where A2E accumulates , and destroys it. Ongoing studies suggest that Lysoclear is safe and effective at targeting A2E, the main toxin driving these diseases, eliminating up to 10% with each dose. This product would be the first clinical candidate based on concepts and research pioneered by SENS Research Foundation. Oisin Biotechnologies is focused on the genetic elimination of unwanted cells, but without involving the immune system. Oisin reports significant progress in showing that their vector works, efficiently transducing cells and delivering a DNA construct which can kill targeted cells on command. Oisin closed a $500K oversubscribed convertible debt round in mid-December and is working towards a substantial Series A in the next few months that would take it towards a Phase 1 clinical trial.', 'start_index': 877, 'publish_date': '2017-06-22'}, page_content=\"capital now, and senescent cell clearance is at the front of the pack.

A comprehensive reformation of the aging research community is nonetheless the goal of the SENS initiative, the Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence - a way to build rejuvenation therapies that work by repairing forms of cell and tissue damage that cause aging. SENS came into being precisely because aging research was not heading in the right direction: researchers were not attempting to treat aging as a medical condition, influential figures were in fact actively suppressing any sort of impetus in that direction , and where there were glimmerings of hope in the form of a few scientists interested in intervening in the aging process, these individuals were focused on strategies that could not possibly do more than slightly slow down age-related degeneration. Over the past fifteen years SENS has progressed from a position statement and a vision for the end of aging, a set of ideas and supporting evidence only, to a modestly sized set of research programs that are now producing results, several non-profit foundations, a web of relationships with a outsized influence on the research community , and the clinical development of the first rejuvenation therapies . SENS has come a long way from the first meetings of a few like-minded researchers and advocates, just after the turn of the century. Now many researchers are openly talking about the causes of aging and the construction of therapies to meaningfully treat aging. The old suppression of this topic has crumbled entirely. It remains the case that most researchers are still stubbornly pursuing approaches that cannot have a large effect on human health and life span , but the initial battle to change the direction of the research community has been fought and won. Now it is just an increasingly vocal and public debate over how best to proceed, and here SENS will win in time as therapies that repair age-related molecular damage are proven to be far cheaper, more effective, and more reliable than other efforts. We have come a long way, but one of the necessary parts of advocacy that I think that our community does poorly is the presentation of this growth and success of past years. There is so much we can point to, and show where and how we came together to make a difference, to change the course of research, to fund and build new advances, to change minds and gather allies. We don't do a good job when it comes to clearly showing the progression from (1) initial idea to (2) non-profit scientific foundations to (3) philanthropic support of research to (4) broader research community participation to (5) proof of concept technology demonstrations to (6) founding of biotechnology companies to (7) venture fundraising to (8) clinical trials of rejuvenation therapies. That long chain now exists nearly end to end for senescent cell clearance as a rejuvenation treatment , and all of the other potential branches of SENS research are underway in some form. So with that in mind, the following timeline references some of the important developments and advances in rejuvenation biotechnology since the origin of the SENS program, from the slow and incremental start to the present more rapid pace. It is by design a high-level and sparse overview, as I wanted to capture the bigger picture without getting dragged down into the details. Watching early stage progress in research from year to year can be a frustrating process, but as senescent cell clearance demonstrates, once a field reaches the tipping point of viability and support, things then move very rapidly. Further, given that this all started with a few ideas and a little persuasion, it is certainly the case that mountains have been moved over the years, even if it feels all too slow on a day to day basis. There is much more to be done ahead, but all who have participated in the past should feel rightfully proud of what has been accomplished, and what continues to be accomplished today. 2002 The first of Aubrey de Grey's collaborative papers , describing SENS as a goal-driven approach to the treatment of aging as a medical condition, is published in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences. 2003 The Methuselah Foundation is created, and the founders launch the Mprize for longevity science, a research prize aiming to spur greater interest in extending healthy life spans. The first SENS-focused academic conference is held in the UK under the auspices of the International Association of Biomedical Gerontology. 2004 The Methuselah Foundation begins to assemble the 300 , a core group of donors who go on to be influential in the course of advocacy and development of rejuvenation biotechnology. Their funds power the early work of the foundation, and some start their own initiatives in later years. 2005 An individual whose identity remains a mystery to this day makes a $1 million donation to the Methuselah Foundation to expand the Mprize purse. The Methuselah Foundation begins funding (a) LysoSENS research , searching for enzymes in soil bacteria capable of consuming age-related metabolic waste, and (b) allotopic expression of mitochondrial genes , aiming to remove the consequences of mitochondrial damage in aging. The Methuselah Foundation sponsors the Supercentenarian Research Foundation , supporting a program of autopsies of supercentenarians. Over the next few years this demonstrates transthyretin amyloidosis to be the majority cause of death . 2006 Peter Thiel publicly supports SENS research with a $3.5M grant. Researchers first demonstrate the creation of induced pluripotent stem cells , a foundation for much of the future of regenerative medicine to replace cells lost to aging . 2008 The Methuselah Foundation expands allotopic expression funding to support a French research group that will go on to establish Gensight Biologics on the strength of this work. The foundation also announces the commencement of research initiatives for most of the other SENS programs: clearing senescent cells, removing metabolic waste such as amyloid and cross-links, and investigation of alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) in the context of cancer. The first US SENS conference is held at UCLA . 2009 The SENS Research Foundation spins off from the Methuselah Foundation to focus entirely on SENS rejuvenation research. GSK and Pentraxin Therapeutics begin a collaboration to develop a therapy capable of clearing transthyretin amyloid. The Methuselah Foundation makes its first outside investment in the Organovo tissue printing startup. 2010 The SENS Research Foundation's yearly budget reaches $1 million. The foundation sets up a laboratory facility in Mountain View, California for ongoing intramural research projects . Jason Hope pledges $500,000 to the SENS Research Foundation to start a research program aimed at developing a viable cross-link breaker for glucosepane in humans. Researchers find that transplanting a young thymus into an old mouse restores immune function and extends life. 2011 Aubrey de Grey devotes the majority of his $16.5M net worth to funding SENS research. The SENS Research Foundation is funding either in-house or external research projects in all of the seven strands of SENS rejuvenation research. Some are very early stage, focused on building tools or discovery, while others are building the basis for therapies. The first demonstration of targeted senescent cell clearance is carried out by an independent research group, producing benefits in mice with an accelerated aging condition. The Methuselah Foundation launches the New Organ tissue engineering initiative. 2012 Gensight Biologics is founded to commercialize allotopic expression of mitochondrial gene ND4, based on the research program supported initially by the Methuselah Foundation, and later the SENS Research Foundation. The SENS Research Foundation demonstrates bacterial enzymes that can break down 7-ketocholesterol in cell culture . Methuselah Foundation supported tissue printing company Organovo becomes publicly traded on NASDAQ. Covalent Bioscience is founded to advance work on catalytic antibodies (or catabodies) to clear the amyloid associated with Alzheimer's disease. 2013 Gensight Biologics raises a $32M series A round. The Methuselah Foundation announces a $1 million research prize for liver tissue engineering as a part of the New Organ initiative. This year the foundation also sponsors organ banking initiatives at the Organ Preservation Alliance . The important Hallmarks of Aging position paper is published , the authors taking a cue from the SENS rejuvenation research proposals, but carving out their own view on damage and repair. Google Ventures launches Calico , adding a great deal of support to aging research with the size and publicity of the investment. Unfortunately Calico goes on to focus on areas of aging research unrelated to rejuvenation. Cenexys is founded to work on the creation of means to selectively destroy senescent cells in aged tissues. 2014 The Methuselah Foundation and SENS Research Foundation provide seed funding to launch Oisin Biotechnologies, to develop a method of targeted clearance of senescent cells. The SENS Research Foundation begins the Rejuvenation Biotechnology conference series , bringing together industry and academia to smooth the path for development of rejuvenation therapies. Following the Hallmarks of Aging, leading researchers publish their Seven Pillars of Aging position, again echoing the long-standing SENS view of aging and its treatment. The SENS Research Foundation funds development of catabodies to break down transthyretin amyloid , and the work shows considerable promise. Human Rejuvenation Technologies is founded to commercialize a treatment for atherosclerosis based on SENS Research Foundation LysoSENS program approaches to clearing metabolic waste compounds. 2015 The SENS Research Foundation's yearly budget reaches $5 million. The Spiegel Lab at Yale announces a method of creating glucosepane , a vital and to this point missing tool needed to develop glucosepane cross-link breaker drugs. This work was funded by the SENS Research Foundation. A research team demonstrates the first senolytic drug candidates capable of selectively destroying senescent cells. The number of candidate drugs increases quite quickly after this point. Pentraxin Therapeutics announces positive results in a trial of targeted clearance of transthyretin amyloid . Meanwhile, evidence continues to emerge from other groups for transthyretin amyloid to have more of an impact in age-related disease that previously thought. SENS Research Foundation work on sabotaging ALT to suppress cancer receives more attention . Meanwhile progress is reported on the other half of telomere extension blockade, interfering in the operation of telomerase, an area in which a number of groups are participating. The Methuselah Foundation makes a founding investment in Leucadia Therapeutics in order to pursue a novel approach to the effective treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The research program producing catabodies capable of breaking down transthyretin amyloid is transferred to Covalent Bioscience for clinical development. 2016 Ichor Therapeutics begins commercial development of a method of clearing metabolic waste from the retina, based on technology developed in the SENS Research Foundation LysoSENS program. Gensight Biologics demonstrates success in a trial of mitochondrial allotopic expression of ND4 as a way to treat inherited mutations of that gene. The underlying technology is proven. SENS Research Foundation scientists, meanwhile, successfully demonstrate allotopic expression of  ATP6 and ATP8 . After more than a decade of high profile failures, amyloid-β is finally cleared from the brain in a small human study using an immunotherapy approach. The SENS Research Foundation crowdfunds a drug discovery program to find candidates that can interfere in ALT, and thus suppress the telomere elongation that cancer depends upon. Cenexys is reformed as Unity Biotechnology with a focus on senolytic drugs. The researchers involved show that clearance of senescent cells in normal mice produces 25% extension of median life span. Later in 2016, the company raises $116M in venture funding. Other work on removal of senescent cells across the year shows restoration of function in aged lung tissue , and improved vascular health . New evidence reinforces the role of senescent cells in osteoarthritis , as well as in atherosclerosis , immunosenescence , and diabetic retinopathy The Methuselah Foundation launches a $500,000 research prize for tissue engineering in collaboration with NASA. Michael Greve pledges $10M to fund SENS research and startup biotechnology companies that emerge from that research. 2017, so far... There are now nearing ten different senolytic drug candidates with openly published evidence, and more in the pipeline. Oisin Biotechnologies announces that their senescent cell clearance technology can also be applied to cancerous cells , reporting successful animal studies for tumor ablation. Methuselah Foundation launches the Methuselah Fund to shepherd more rejuvenation-related biotechnology startups towards success.\", 'start_index': 1665}, page_content=\"aging. The old suppression of this topic has crumbled entirely. It remains the case that most researchers are still stubbornly pursuing approaches that cannot have a large effect on human health and life span , but the initial battle to change the direction of the research community has been fought and won. Now it is just an increasingly vocal and public debate over how best to proceed, and here SENS will win in time as therapies that repair age-related molecular damage are proven to be far cheaper, more effective, and more reliable than other efforts. We have come a long way, but one of the necessary parts of advocacy that I think that our community does poorly is the presentation of this growth and success of past years. There is so much we can point to, and show where and how we came together to make a difference, to change the course of research, to fund and build new advances, to change minds and gather allies. We don't do a good job when it comes to clearly showing the\"), Document(metadata={'url': 'https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2017/07/signs-of-the-spreading-interest-in-cellular-senescence-as-a-cause-of-aging/', 'body': 'In just a few short years, the study of cellular senescence has grown enormously. It has become an area of intense interest and funding in comparison to its prior status as a thin sideline of cancer research and a yet another of the backwaters of aging research. Sadly, aging research considered as a whole is still a neglected, poorly funded field of medical science in comparison to its importance to all of our futures, but this will hopefully change soon. The 2011 demonstration of a slowing of degeneration in an accelerated aging lineage of mice via removal of senescent cells opened a great many eyes. A growing number of studies since then have shown reversal of many specific aspects of aging through clearance of senescent cells, and the potential for removal of senescent cells to form the basis for the effective treatment of many age-related diseases. These studies are accompanied by varied approaches to the selective destruction of these unwanted, harmful cells in aged tissues, including several classes of drug compound , gene therapies , and antibody therapies . This is an important transition for the study of aging as a medical condition: the first legitimate, working rejuvenation therapies now exist in their earliest stages. They have become a reality. From here the field will only become ever more promising. The July issue of EBioMedicine gathers together papers from recent months to focus on aging and metabolism. Prominent in this collection are papers on the biology of senescent cells, the contribution of senescent cells to aging, and methods of selectively destroying senescent cells. I pointed out a few of these when they were first published online earlier this year, but I think it worth looking through the collection as it is presented here. This is the future: the stream that will become a flood, a huge new industry of medicine. It is impossible to work in the medical life sciences without having heard something of this newly important area of research and development. Senolytic therapies capable of safely clearing a large fraction of the burden of senescent cells in old individuals may well do more for health in later life than all of the heralded advances of the past thirty years, statins and early stem cell therapies included. These are exciting times that we live in - and then, I would hope, not too many years from now, we\\'ll be able to say all of this again as glucosepane cross-link breakers become a reality as well , another line of rejuvenation research that should be just as influential, at the very least for cardiovascular health. Aging and Metabolism: Two Sides of the Same Coin The mounting challenges healthcare systems face with an aging population are largely due to increased prevalence of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) . In 2015, NCDs accounted for 70% of all deaths globally . 80% of NCD-related deaths are attributed to cardiovascular disease , cancer, respiratory diseases , and diabetes . In this issue find a series of articles discussing diverse aspects of geroscience - the relatively new field of understanding the biology of aging and age-related disease. At the core of geroscience research is the dogma that aging is not simply an immutable outcome of life, but that its biological underpinnings, once understood, can be manipulated to improve health. From the series of pieces presented in this issue, it becomes apparent that aging and age-related disease are intimately entangled with metabolic function , both at the molecular/cellular and organismal levels. The etiology of cardiovascular disease, cancer, lung, liver, and kidney dysfunction, and diabetes can be at least in part attributed to metabolic defects associated with increasing age. Cellular senescence describes the phenomenon where somatic cells cease to divide, become resistant to apoptosis , and develop a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that can have deleterious effects on surrounding tissues and throughout the body. One article discusses the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in cellular senescence and how breakdown of mitochondrial components ( mitophagy ) is likely involved in senescence and aging. How telomeres - irrespective of length, contrary to the previous notion that shortened telomeres were simply a readout of a cell\\'s age - can both protect against and effect cellular senescence programs is discussed in another article. Translational approaches to targeting the biological basis of aging is a rapidly-developing field. A third article discusses targeting cellular senescence programs to improve fitness. Among these approaches are so-called senolytic agents, which selectively clear senescent cells and relieve the associated pathophysiology they confer. Telomeres and Cell Senescence - Size Matters Not So far, the best explanation for replicative senescence is the shortening of telomeres, regions composed of DNA repeats associated with proteins, found at the ends of chromosomes . In the 1990s, it was shown that telomere regions gradually shorten with cell division and that this correlates with the induction of cellular senescence. Importantly, it was demonstrated that ectopic expression of the enzyme telomerase , which is capable of elongating telomeres, counteracts telomere shortening driven by cell division and bypasses the senescence arrest. This experiment demonstrated that telomere length was the limiting factor in the senescence arrest and therefore played a causal role in the process. Since then, great advances have been made in the understanding of how telomeres are able to signal the senescence arrest. These mechanisms are of particular importance in the field of ageing, since cellular senescence, driven by telomere dysfunction, has been shown to be a causal driver of ageing and age-related pathology. In recent years, important conceptual advances have been made in terms of our understanding of the role of senescent cells in vivo . It is now clear that the impact of senescence in vivo is not restricted to the loss of proliferative capacity. Apart from the cell-cycle arrest, senescent cells have been shown to experience dramatic changes in terms of gene expression , metabolism, epigenome and importantly, have been shown to have a distinct secretome profile, known as the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP), which mediates the interactions between senescent and neighboring cells. The SASP includes pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as growth factors and extracellular matrix degrading proteins and is thought to have evolved as a way for senescent cells to communicate with the immune system (potentially to facilitate their own clearance), but also as an extracellular signal to promote the regeneration of tissues through the stimulation of nearby progenitor cells . Nonetheless, it has been shown that a \"chronic\" SASP is able to induce senescence in adjacent young cells, contributing to tissue dysfunction. Recent data indicates that senescent cells play a variety of beneficial roles during processes such as embryonic development , tumor suppression, wound healing and tissue repair . On the other hand, senescent cells have been detected in multiple age-related diseases and in a variety of different tissues during ageing. The positive and negative effects of senescence in different physiological contexts may be a reflection of the ability of the immune system to effectively clear senescent cells. It has been speculated that an \"acute\" type of senescence plays generally beneficial roles in processes such as embryonic development and wound-healing, while a \"chronic\" type of senescence may contribute to ageing and age-related disease. The role of telomeres in the induction of these two types of senescence is still unclear. In this review, we will first describe evidence suggesting a key role for senescence in the ageing process and elaborate on some of the mechanisms by which telomeres can induce cellular senescence. Furthermore, we will present multiple lines of evidence suggesting that telomeres can act as sensors of both intrinsic and extrinsic stress as well as recent data indicating that telomere-induced senescence may occur irrespectively of the length of telomeres. Mitochondria in cell senescence: Is mitophagy the weakest link? Cell senescence is increasingly recognized as a major contributor to the loss of health and fitness associated with aging. Senescent cells accumulate dysfunctional mitochondria ; oxidative phosphorylation efficiency is decreased and reactive oxygen species production is increased. In this review we will discuss how the turnover of mitochondria (a term referred to as mitophagy) is perturbed in senescence contributing to mitochondrial accumulation and Senescence-Associated Mitochondrial Dysfunction (SAMD). We will further explore the subsequent cellular consequences; in particular SAMD appears to be necessary for at least part of the specific Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP) and may be responsible for tissue-level metabolic dysfunction that is associated with aging and obesity. Understanding the complex interplay between these major senescence-associated phenotypes will help to select and improve interventions that prolong healthy life in humans. Cellular Senescence: A Translational Perspective There is a possibility that senolytics and SASP inhibitors could be transformative, substantially benefiting the large numbers on patients with chronic diseases and enhancing healthspan. That said, as this is a very new treatment paradigm, there are many obstacles to overcome. At least one reassuring advantage of targeting cellular senescence is the conservation of fundamental aging mechanisms such as senescence across mammalian species, however, reducing the risk of results in mice failing to translate to humans. Furthermore, unlike the situation for developing drugs to eliminate infectious agents or cancer cells, not every senescent cell needs to be eliminated to have beneficial effects. Unlike microbes or cancer cells, senescent cells do not divide, decreasing risk of developing drug resistance and, possibly, speed of recurrence. With respect to risk of side-effects, single or intermittent doses of senolytics appear to alleviate at least some age- or senescence-related conditions in mice. This suggests that intermittent treatment may eventually be feasible in humans, perhaps given during periods of good health. If so, this would reduce risk of side-effects. Progression from the discovery of the first senolytics to being at the point of initiating proof-of-concept clinical trials has been remarkably fast. With sustained effort and a lot of luck, these agents could be transformative.', 'publish_date': '2017-07-21', 'title': 'Signs of the Spreading Interest in Cellular Senescence as a Cause of Aging', 'start_index': 1680}, page_content=\"senescent cells.

      "--- ⬅️  Final Answer ---\n",
      "Based on the provided context from the FightAging.org blog, here is a multi-part summary addressing your questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Evolution in Research Focus Over the Last Two Decades\n",
      "\n",
      "The research focus has evolved from a foundational, advocacy-driven phase to a more translational and commercially viable phase.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Foundational Focus (Early 2000s):** The early years were dominated by the establishment and promotion of the SENS (Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence) research framework. This was an \"engineering approach\" that sought to classify aging as a medical condition caused by a few core types of cellular and molecular damage. The focus was on:\n",
      "    *   **Advocacy and Bootstrapping:** Convincing the scientific community and the public that treating aging was a plausible and worthwhile goal. This involved organizing conferences (SENS1-6), publishing foundational papers, and building a community of supporters.\n",
      "    *   **Foundational Science:** Early research focused on identifying and developing the tools to address the seven proposed categories of aging damage. Key early projects included:\n",
      "        *   **MitoSENS:** Developing allotopic expression of mitochondrial genes to combat mitochondrial DNA mutations.\n",
      "        *   **LysoSENS:** Searching for bacterial enzymes to break down intracellular metabolic waste like A2E (in the retina) and extracellular aggregates like amyloid.\n",
      "        *   **GlycoSENS:** Researching ways to break age-related cross-links in the extracellular matrix, such as glucosepane.\n",
      "        *   **OncoSENS:** Investigating ways to block cancer's ability to maintain telomeres, specifically the Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Translational and Emerging Focus (Recent Years):** The focus has shifted towards moving these foundational ideas into clinical application and exploring new, complex biological systems. This shift was catalyzed by specific, high-impact discoveries.\n",
      "    *   **Translational Science:** The conversation is now heavily centered on taking proven concepts from the lab into human trials. The blog frequently discusses startup companies, venture funding, and clinical trial pathways.\n",
      "    *   **Dominance of Cellular Senescence:** As detailed in the next section, the successful demonstration that clearing senescent cells could reverse aspects of aging in mice (circa 2011) made this area a central and highly funded topic.\n",
      "    *   **Emerging Fields:** While the core SENS damage categories remain the framework, the blog notes growing interest in other areas, though the provided context has less detail on the gut microbiome specifically. More prominent emerging topics mentioned include:\n",
      "        *   **Epigenetic Reprogramming:** Using techniques to reset epigenetic marks to a more youthful state, with several companies (e.g., Turn Bio, Retro Biosciences, Altos Labs) actively working in this area.\n",
      "        *   **Advanced Delivery Systems:** Developing better gene therapies, mRNA therapies (LNP-mRNA), and tissue-targeted delivery systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. The Centrality of Cellular Senescence and the SASP\n",
      "\n",
      "Cellular senescence became central due to compelling evidence that these cells are not just dormant but actively harmful, and that removing them produces measurable rejuvenation.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Specific Molecular Reasons for Centrality:**\n",
      "    1.  **Accumulation with Age:** Senescent cells accumulate in tissues with advancing age.\n",
      "    2.  **Active Harm (The SASP):** The critical discovery was that senescent cells are not passive; they adopt a **Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP)**. The SASP is a potent mix of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and matrix-degrading enzymes that these cells secrete.\n",
      "    3.  **Proof-of-Concept Reversal:** The pivotal moment was a 2011 study where genetically targeting senescent cells for destruction in mice led to improved health, reversal of multiple age-related conditions, and extended lifespan. This demonstrated that senescence was a cause, not just a correlate, of aging.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Shift in Therapeutic Focus:** The discovery of the SASP shifted the therapeutic focus from merely understanding senescence to actively eliminating these cells.\n",
      "    *   The goal moved from slowing the *creation* of senescent cells to *clearing* the existing, harmful ones—a true rejuvenation strategy.\n",
      "    *   This led to the birth of the **senolytics** field: drugs and therapies designed to selectively induce apoptosis (cell death) in senescent cells while sparing healthy ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Most Promising Therapeutic Strategies Today\n",
      "\n",
      "The most promising strategies discussed are those that have moved beyond basic research and are progressing towards human clinical trials, with senolytics leading the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Senolytic Therapies:** This is the most advanced area, with multiple companies and approaches.\n",
      "    *   **Small Molecule Drugs:** First-generation senolytics like Dasatinib and Quercetin, and more selective second-generation drugs are in development.\n",
      "    *   **Other Modalities:** The field has expanded to include **immunotherapies** (e.g., CAR-NK cells to target senescent cells), **gene therapies** (e.g., Oisin Biotechnologies' approach), and **peptide-based** treatments.\n",
      "    *   **Clinical Progress:** Companies like **Unity Biotechnology** are already in clinical trials (e.g., for osteoarthritis), and others are noted as being 12-24 months away from trials. The blog states that clearance of senescent cells is the first SENS-inspired therapy to reach well-funded clinical development.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Other SENS-Inspired Therapies Nearing Translation:**\n",
      "    *   **Cross-Link Breakers:** Research is advancing on drugs to break glucosepane cross-links that stiffen tissues like arteries and skin. The Spiegel Lab, funded by SENS, developed the first synthetic route to create glucosepane, a critical step towards discovering breakers.\n",
      "    *   **Amyloid Clearance:** Therapies targeting harmful amyloid aggregates, such as transthyretin amyloid in the heart, are being developed. This includes the use of catalytic antibodies (\"catabodies\") that can degrade these aggregates.\n",
      "    *   **LysoSENS Applications:** Projects to clear metabolic waste are being commercialized. For example, **Ichor Therapeutics** is developing \"Lysoclear,\" an enzyme therapy for age-related macular degeneration that targets a waste product called A2E.\n",
      "    *   **Mitochondrial Restoration:** Allotopic expression of mitochondrial genes has been proven in concept, with companies like **Gensight Biologics** advancing related therapies for inherited mitochondrial diseases, paving the way for broader anti-aging applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the blog charts a path from a theoretical, advocacy-focused foundation (SENS) to a practical, therapeutic landscape dominated by the breakthrough of senolytics, with several other repair-based strategies now maturing and approaching the clinic.\n"
