      "[Document(metadata={'publish_date': '2016-09-06', 'url': 'https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2016/09/considering-age-reversal-therapeutics/', 'body': 'Age Reversal Therapeutics is an initiative launched by quite the varied set of people : leaders from the \"anti-aging\" marketplace\\'s Life Extension Foundation , a SENS Research Foundation researcher, a selection of biotech industry veterans, a practitioner of anti-aging medicine, and a reputable genetics researcher quite well known in our community. Strange bedfellows indeed - a meeting of many houses of the broader community interested in aging, houses that typically don\\'t have much to do with one another, and indeed in some cases don\\'t think much of one another. The basic plan here is to raise money from investors and then put it into some of the most promising of recent research and development initiatives in the treatment of aging. It is intended to be one of those hybrids that is something like a company and something like an investment fund. You can read their plans in some detail in their large PDF prospectus ; scroll all the way down past the legal and fiscal matters to page 124 for the discussion of what exactly they intend to fund and the overall goals of the venture. It is my belief that over the long term the currently terrible \"anti-aging\" marketplace will see the useless pills, creams, supplements, and potions replaced by rejuvenation technologies that actually work - as those technologies emerge from the scientific community, that is. The \"anti-aging\" marketplace always was, to a very large degree, a pipeline established by earnest believers in the end goal of extending healthy life spans, but who were unfortunate enough to have found that calling well in advance of the existence of any way to meaningfully alter the course of aging. Having the heart in the right place doesn\\'t excuse what came next, of course, in which any old junk was thrust into the market in order to make money from the credulous, and thanks to the megaphone of marketing the whole concept of intervening in the aging process became synonymous in many eyes with rampant fraud over the course of the last few decades of the last century. This history does explain why some of the notable companies in the space, such as the supplement seller Life Extension Foundation, do in fact devote funding to legitimate research that you and I might approve of: stem cell trials, SENS programs, cryopreservation technology , targeted cancer therapies, and the like. Age Reversal Therapeutics represents one of a number of possible next steps beyond those activities, now that the environment and awareness of aging as a therapeutic target has advanced to the point at which the rejuvenation therapy of senescent cell clearance is under development in startups, Calico Labs and Human Longevity have raised large sums, and other efforts make it clear that there is money out there for meaningful commercial work on the problem of aging. The question is how to take this new enthusiasm among for-profit investors and turn it into the research funding still needed to push new rejuvenation therapies to the point of commercial viability. Years of work and millions of dollars in fundraising yet remain to be accomplished to reach that point in most cases. The SENS Research Foundation has launched Project|21 as one possible answer to this question. Age Reversal Therapeutics is another possible answer. There are other groups out there taking the more traditional paths of establishing venture funds or starting their own companies. Old habits die hard, sad to say, and most investors are not yet willing to abandon profit as the primary marker of success, when the only real measure of success is future health and longevity. What use is financial profit to those crippled by age, who cannot buy the only thing they really want? I think the next ten to twenty years of transition in the \"anti-aging\" marketplace from junk and outright lies to therapies that work is going to be messy for any poorly educated consumer. For people like me it will be increasingly hard to draw good lines between good and bad initiatives. We are absolutely going to see clinics marketed as anti-aging salons selling fully functional senescent cell clearance treatments in a package with entirely useless apple stem cell facial scrubs , and making little effort to educate their customers as to where the benefit comes from. We will eventually see clinics selling packages wherein, unlike the obvious example above, I cannot make a good judgement call as to which components are worth the candle. The glass half full view is that this will be much better than the present situation. An \"anti-aging\" marketplace in which only 10% of the products actually work is still 10% better than what we have today.

Insofar as the degenerations of aging go, the present consensus appears to be that exercise in humans slows aging to around the same degree as calorie restriction in humans . Where else could you go to find a fairly cost-effective way of extending your healthy life expectancy by a decade or so? (Or from the glass half empty perspective, we might add lack of exercise and eating too much to the list of ways to shorten your healthy life expectancy by a decade or so - like smoking, for example ). The multiple mechanisms involved in producing the benefits of calorie restriction and exercise are incompletely understood but known to overlap to some degree: hormesis , for example, heat shock proteins , and lower amounts of of visceral body fat . But on either side there are likely distinct processes at work. There is every reason to expect exercise and calorie restriction practiced together to produce greater benefits than just one or the other. Here is something interesting noted in a recent research paper - though you might derive more value from the popular science release : Long-term exercise training activates telomerase and reduces telomere shortening in human leukocytes . The age-dependent telomere loss was lower in the master athletes who had performed endurance exercising for several decades. ... \"The most significant finding of this study is that physical exercise of the professional athletes leads to activation of the important enzyme telomerase and stabilizes the telomere,\" said Ulrich Laufs, M.D., the study\\'s lead author and professor of clinical and experimental medicine in the department of internal medicine at Saarland University in Homburg, Germany. \"This is direct evidence of an anti-aging effect of physical exercise. Physical exercise could prevent the aging of the cardiovascular system, reflecting this molecular principle.\" This is in one cell population amongst thousands, of course - and there still remain questions about telomere biology and its relationship to age-related degeneration. Is it more of a cause of aging or more of a marker of aging - is telomere shortening a consequence of mitochondrial DNA damage , for example? That damage is the villain in the mitochondrial free radical theory of aging . We know that exercise correlates with lower levels of mitochondrial DNA damage , and it looks much as though mitochondrial DNA damage correlates with shorter telomeres. At this point there are all sorts of plausible theories floating around - more plausible on the mitochondrial side of the pool from where I stand - but the telomere researchers and mitochondria researchers haven\\'t hammered in that last stake to prove root causes beyond any reasonable debate. This is one of the many areas in which the Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence approach shines. We have a list of items that change with aging: here (a) mitochondrial DNA, (b) telomere length. We could spend an age working on a complete understanding, or we could instead start work immediately on methods to reverse both changes.

It is my belief that over the long term the currently terrible \"anti-aging\" marketplace will see the useless pills, creams, supplements, and potions replaced by rejuvenation technologies that actually work - as those technologies emerge from the scientific community, that is. The \"anti-aging\" marketplace always was, to a very large degree, a pipeline established by earnest believers in the end goal of extending healthy life spans, but who were unfortunate enough to have found that calling well in advance of the existence of any way to meaningfully alter the course of aging. Having the heart in the right place doesn\\'t excuse what came next, of course, in which any old junk was thrust into the market in order to make money from the credulous, and thanks to the megaphone of marketing the whole concept of intervening in the aging process became synonymous in many eyes with rampant fraud over the course of the last few decades of the last century. This history does explain why some of the notable companies in the space, such as the supplement seller Life Extension Foundation, do in fact devote funding to legitimate research that you and I might approve of: stem cell trials, SENS programs, cryopreservation technology , targeted cancer therapies, and the like. Age Reversal Therapeutics represents one of a number of possible next steps beyond those activities, now that the environment and awareness of aging as a therapeutic target has advanced to the point at which the rejuvenation therapy of senescent cell clearance is under development in startups, Calico Labs and Human Longevity have raised large sums, and other efforts make it clear that there is money out there for meaningful commercial work on the problem of aging. The question is how to take this new enthusiasm among for-profit investors and turn it into the research funding still needed to push new rejuvenation therapies to the point of commercial viability. Years of work and millions of dollars in fundraising yet remain to be accomplished to reach that point in most cases. The SENS Research Foundation has launched Project|21 as one possible answer to this question. Age Reversal Therapeutics is another possible answer. There are other groups out there taking the more traditional paths of establishing venture funds or starting their own companies. Old habits die hard, sad to say, and most investors are not yet willing to abandon profit as the primary marker of success, when the only real measure of success is future health and longevity. What use is financial profit to those crippled by age, who cannot buy the only thing they really want? I think the next ten to twenty years of transition in the \"anti-aging\" marketplace from junk and outright lies to therapies that work is going to be messy for any poorly educated consumer. For people like me it will be increasingly hard to draw good lines between good and bad initiatives. We are absolutely going to see clinics marketed as anti-aging salons selling fully functional senescent cell clearance treatments in a package with entirely useless apple stem cell facial scrubs , and making little effort to educate their customers as to where the benefit comes from. We will eventually see clinics selling packages wherein, unlike the obvious example above, I cannot make a good judgement call as to which components are worth the candle. The glass half full view is that this will be much better than the present situation. An \"anti-aging\" marketplace in which only 10% of the products actually work is still 10% better than what we have today.

What is the core concept of \" Ending Aging \"? What would you like to achieve through your project? AG: At SENS Research Foundation we are focused on developing rejuvenation biotechnologies , which means medicines that can not just slow down aging but actually reverse it. We want to take people who are already in middle age or older and restore their physical and mental function to that of a young adult. We aim to do that by repairing the molecular and cellular damage that the body does to itself throughout life as side-effects of its normal operation. C: What drives you to pursue your mission, spending lots of time and capital? AG: I\\'ve always been driven by humanitarian motives, so I want to work on problems that cause human suffering. Aging undoubtedly causes far more human suffering than anything else . The strange thing is that there are so few people who think that way: lots of people claim to be humanitarian, but hardly anyone thinks aging is really important. C: How did you get interested in science, gerontology, and aging? AG: I got interested when I discovered how few other people are interested - even biologists. Until I was about 30, I had totally assumed that everyone understood how serious a problem aging is and that lots of experts were working hard to defeat it. After I married a senior biologist and discovered that that wasn\\'t true, it was an easy decision to switch from my previous career as a computer scientist. C: How does your experience in computer science help you understand aging and come up with solutions for that? AG: It was extremely helpful. The first reason is just that computer science is a very different field; quite often in science people have made important breakthroughs after switching fields, because they are not blinkered by the new field\\'s \"conventional wisdom\". Second, computer science is a very goal-directed, technological field, whereas pretty much everyone else in gerontology back then was much more of a basic scientist - great at testing hypotheses so as to understand nature better, but not so good at seeing how to use existing knowledge to manipulate nature. C: In order to raise capital for visionary projects and ideas, what are important things for entrepreneurs, scientists, and futurists to remember? AG: I sometimes give a talk on that topic, called \"How to be a successful heretic\" .

I notice that the editorial in this issue comments on a recent Scientific American article in a useful fashion. That article examined the two positions on strategy held by by researchers in the mainstream of aging science, most of whom look to achieve only a modest slowing of aging through their work. Or at least, these are positions held in that portion of the community interested in extending life spans at all, which is probably at this point a majority but by no means all of the field: One group believes lifespan can be extended by limiting diseases one at a time. ... The other group believes the actual underlying aging pathway itself can be slowed. These positions within the mainstream are distinct from those of the smaller Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS) camp and like-minded allies, researchers who seek to repair and reverse the root causes of aging rather than just slow it down a bit. The SENS viewpoint is in need of greater attention, however, as it remains overlooked by those who paint the field with broad brush strokes. One point of this exercise is to note that there exists more than just the one strategic debate in aging research: it\\'s isn\\'t only a matter of arguing for the goal of rejuvenation versus the goal of slowing aging , though I see that as the most important of all such divisions in the scientific community, the debate that will determine whether those of us in middle age now will benefit from a meaningful extension of healthy life span . After all, the battle over whether or not to intervene at all in aging is still being fought to some degree, depressingly enough: until comparatively recently the scientific community would neither discuss nor sanction any discussion of engineering greater human longevity. Remember that this community is far from a monolith, however, and every position has its varied internal factions and smaller rifts. In any case, here is a pertinent quote from the Rejuvenation Research editorial , penned by Aubrey de Grey : The September 2012 issue of Scientific American includes a commentary contrasting two approaches to combating aging. Like almost all general-audience piece, and despite the best efforts of most experts in the field, it highlights the goal of life extension rather than stressing that any longevity benefits will be a side effect of health benefits ... The value of the article, though diminished thereby, is still substantial, in that it provides a clear description of the contrast between the \"combat one disease at a time\" approach generally taken by geriatricians and the holistic \"combat aging itself\" approach favored by most biogerontologists . As those readers familiar with my work will know, I view both such approaches as highly unlikely to deliver substantial postponement of age-related ill health in the remotely foreseeable future, but not for the reasons generally given by the proponents of the other approach. Geriatricians reject combating of \"aging itself\" because they don\\'t generally view aging as a medical condition at all, but instead merely view chronological age as a risk factor for various types of ill health. Biogerontologists, conversely, reject the \"one disease at a time\" approach because they believe that there will always be something - the very same \"aging itself,\" of course - that will be a source of exponentially accelerating ill health however many specifics are defeated. The SENS perspective is that it is inaccurate and misleading to draw a sharp distinction between \"aging itself\" and the specific aspects of age-related ill health, first because where one draws that distinction is arbitrary - Are foam cells atherosclerosis yet, for example? Are fatty streaks? - and second because the lifelong changes that drive ill health, and thus hold the the only logical claim to be lumped under the term \"aging,\" are themselves not aspects of any meaningful unitary process, but are instead relatively independent processes occurring as side-effects of different aspects of metabolism .', 'start_index': 0}, page_content='More Considerations of Strategy in Aging Research'), Document(metadata={'publish_date': '2003-02-10', 'url': 'https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2003/02/pieces-of-the-puzzle-aging-research-today-and-tomorrow/', 'title': 'Pieces of the Puzzle: Aging Research Today and Tomorrow', 'body': 'Dr. Leonid A. Gavrilov gives us a fascinating tour of the current state of aging research, suggestions for the future, and an overview of some of his most interesting work. More of Dr. Gavrilov\\'s scientific work can be found his website . What is Aging? Aging is a summary term for a set of processes that -- over time -- contribute to the deterioration of health and ultimately death. Any process that contributes to age-related decline in performance, productivity and health is a component of the aging process that deserves our attention and intervention. Intervention in this context can include preventative strategies (such as diet, lifestyle and supplement use) along with the development and use of anti-aging medicines and medical technologies. Aging can be thought of as a group of processes responsible for an increasing risk of frailty, disability, age-related degenerative diseases and ultimately death. This interpretation of aging matches the general definition of an aging system in reliability theory. An aging body -- like an aging automobile or household appliance -- is a system that experiences an increasing rate of failure with the passing of time. While failure in an automobile might be a faulty alternator, failure in the human body might be cancer, a degenerative disease such as Alzheimer\\'s or liver failure. Aging is a many-headed monster, and this causes problems for researchers. There are many types of age-related failures in the body (such as disabilities and degenerative conditions), often occurring simultaneously. Aging is not a simple process or progression. Rather it is a complex multidimensional phenomenon. Attempts to describe aging using one measure -- \"biological age,\" \"physiological age,\" or \"real age\" -- may be a misleading and even deceptive oversimplification. More adequate scientific language to describe the aging phenomenon can be found in general system theory and reliability theory. Reliability theory predicts that a system may deteriorate with age even if it is built from elements that do not themselves age, but instead have constant failure rates. The key issue here is the overall redundancy of irreplaceable elements: ongoing failure of these elements is responsible for the aging phenomenon. Each small step in the deterioration of the system may seem to be random. If a system failure requires a sequence of several such small steps, then the system as a whole may have an aging behavior. To return to our examples, the front end assembly of an automobile will not fail until many small brackets and components have worn or broken. Similarly, many degenerative diseases or age-related conditions may be the end result of a chain of lesser failures and \"breakages\" in the human body. Why is it important to make this very careful definition of aging? Because the significance of anti-aging medicine and technologies are often undermined by claims that these interventions are not proven to delay the process of aging itself. Instead they are said to simply delay or \"cover-up\" some particular manifestations of aging (e.g. disabilities, degenerative conditions and so forth). In contrast to these pessimistic views, reliability theory tells us that there may be no specific underlying elementary \"aging process.\" Instead aging may be largely a property of redundant systems as a whole. Each set of possible failures over time could be associated with a particular manifestations of aging. Therefore, we should not be discouraged by the partial success of each particular anti-aging intervention. Instead, how much better it is to appreciate that we have opportunities to oppose aging in so many different ways! Thus, we can conclude that ongoing and valuable efforts to understand the early stages of age-related degenerative diseases should not be discarded as irrelevant to understanding \"true biological aging\". On the contrary, attempts to build a Berlin wall between biogerontology (the study of aging) and clinical medicine (such as the study of specific age-related degenerative diseases) are counterproductive. We should not forget that the main aging-related concerns for most people are deterioration of health and increased risk of death. The most important changes that occur with age are those that make older people sick. How Aging is Viewed by the Scientific Community Views on aging have changed dramatically. They have become more diverse and polarized in recent years. Just a decade ago, there was almost a consensus for considering aging to be an irreversible, universal, intrinsic process. Aging was often considered to be an immutable fundamental process; it was believed that little could be done about it. As an example, it was believed that genetic mutations could only shorten lifespan, not increase it. Even if some mutants lived longer lives, the suggestion was that this came with the cost of a crippled life. Aging was considered to be a general form of gradual deterioration. Therefore, it was thought that any search for specific medicines and technologies to greatly increase lifespan would be futile and destined for failure. It was also believed that each living being has a specific maximum possible lifespan, which was set in stone for any given species. In the 1980s, we first challenged the concept of species-specific maximum lifespan, argued that there is no fixed limit to longevity and suggested a reliability theory of aging. We brought forward the possibility that rates of mortality in later life can be reduced. The scientific debates were heated, and only after publication of our book in 1991 were our arguments taken seriously. Now we are pleased to observe that the idea of a fixed upper limit to lifespan is rejected by many other researchers. There is a real fuss now over late-life reduction in mortality rates, which was described and explained in our book. The idea of the fundamental, immutable nature of aging is now challenged in professional scientific journals. Aging studies are now in the state of paradigm shift. To be more direct, a scientific revolution is currently in progress. Controversies are inevitable in such transition periods and they do indeed exist today. The most important current controversy is related to the evolutionary explanation of aging. Evolutionary biologists have always very generous in providing advice and guidance to gerontologists on how to take aging research \"in directions that are likely to be fruitful.\" Surprisingly, this generous intellectual assistance proved to be extremely injurious for aging studies. Evolutionary theory was interpreted to indicate a search for life-extending single-gene mutations, medicine or technology was futile; destined to failure for fundamental evolutionary reasons. Researchers were convinced by the forceful evolutionary arguments of George Williams that: \"natural selection will always be in greatest opposition to the decline of the most senescence-prone system\" and, therefore: \"Senescence should always be a generalized deterioration, and never due largely to changes in a single system. This conclusion banishes the \\'fountain of youth\\' to the limbo of scientific impossibilities where other human aspirations, like the perpetual motion machine and Laplace\\'s \\'superman\\' have already been placed by other theoretical considerations. Such conclusions are always disappointing, but they have the desirable consequence of channeling research in directions that are likely to be fruitful.\" [Williams, G.C. (1957) Pleiotropy, natural selection and the evolution of senescence. Evolution 11, 398 411] As a result of this triumphant evolutionary indoctrination, exciting research opportunities for life extension were squandered for half a century. Recently, however, the astonishing discovery of single-gene mutants with profoundly extended longevity was finally made, despite all discouraging predictions and warnings based on evolutionary arguments. The recent discoveries of lifespan-extending mutations are spectacular. A single-gene mutation (\"daf-2\") more than doubles the lifespan of nematode worms, keeping them active, fully fertile (contrary to the predictions of some evolutionary theories), and with normal metabolic rates. Another single-gene mutation (\"methuselah\"), extends the average lifespan of fruitflies by about 35% and enhances resistance to various forms of stress, including starvation, high temperature, and toxic chemicals. Finally, a single-gene mutation was found in mice that extended lifespans by about 30% and increased their resistance to toxic chemicals. Researchers involved in these studies came to the following conclusion: \"The field of ageing research has been completely transformed in the past decade. When single genes are changed, animals that should be old stay young. In humans, these mutants would be analogous to a ninety year old who looks and feels forty-five. On this basis we begin to think of ageing as a disease that can be cured, or at least postponed.The field of ageing is beginning to explode, because so many are so excited about the prospect of searching for -- and finding -- the causes of ageing, and maybe even the fountain of youth itself.\" [Guarente, L. and Kenyon, C. (2000) Genetic pathways that regulate ageing in model organisms. Nature 408, 255 262]. Now that single-gene life-extending mutations have been found, evolutionary biologists are presented with the task of reconciling these new discoveries with their theories. Gerontologists have an important lesson to learn from the damage caused by decades of misguided research, during which the search for major life-extending mutations, medicine and technology was equated to the construction of perpetual motion machine by evolutionary biologists. All told, we really do live in an interesting time. New ideas about aging are here! Intervening in the Aging Process Human aging seems to have already altered dramatically in developed countries over the last 50 years, although these significant changes are not yet completely understood and appreciated both by the scientific community and the general public. This remarkable shift in the human aging schedule is largely overlooked by researchers and society. These historical changes have been slow and gradual, and we still do not understand exactly why and how they happened. Why should we question and perhaps reconsider the conventional idea that human aging is immutable, set in stone? The idea of immutable aging was supported in the past by demographic observations. Increases in human life expectancy were caused mainly by preventing deaths at young ages, while death rates at older ages (above age 80, for example) remained surprisingly stable. Demographers know this concept as \"rectangularization of the survival curve.\" This very unwieldy term is used because the survival curve (showing the number of survivors as a function of age) has evolved throughout history towards a more rectangular shape. We were evolving into a society with a \"compression of mortality\" at older ages as more people survived to die closer to what was supposed to be the maximum possible human lifespan. This fixed biological limit to human longevity was believed to be determined by an immutable aging process. In 1985, we challenged this conventional concept in our study \"A new trend in human mortality decline: Derectangularization of the survival curve\" published by the Journal of American Aging Association (Age, 1985, v. 8, p.93). Specifically, we discovered a new trend in mortality decline in developed countries like Sweden after the 1950s. There was a preferential and accelerating decrease in death rates among very old people. This paradoxical observation was later published in a more elaborate form in our book in 1991. These findings challenged the existing scientific paradigm of immutable aging, and therefore they experienced several standard steps of scientific denial. Initially, these findings were simply ignored as if they did not exist. Doubts were cast over the data quality for mortality rates. Finally, when the unprecedented historical decline in mortality rates among the oldest members of the populace could no longer be ignored or disputed, it was claimed that these declines were not related to changes in human aging. Instead, it was claimed that these declines represented the undesired consequences of medical success in sustaining life, as more and more people are kept alive by artificial means in greatly debilitated and degraded conditions! This is simply not the case. The key issue here is that not only did death rates decline preferentially among the oldest members of the populace, but their health status improved significantly over time as well. We observed that the time schedule for the manifestations of aging has been dramatically altered over the last 50 years in developed countries, and this fortunate trend seems to accelerate over time. In other words, the oldest people are living more healthily for longer. If human aging is already altered, then the next question is \"why has this happened?\" I wish I knew the answer to this question, but there are some plausible working hypotheses to explore. Aging retardation may be partially related to better nutrition among people who were fortunate enough to be born more recently. Early-life nutrition history is in fact a very serious matter. Even a trivial deficiency in micronutrients (i.e. essential vitamins, minerals and so forth) has the same devastating impact on DNA integrity as ionizing radiation, as found by Prof. Bruce Ames at Berkeley. People are terrified by the threat of radioactive pollution, yet they receive far more damage to their DNA from minor micronutrient deficiencies! There has been a remarkable improvement in vitamin consumption over the last century, and this might contribute to the observed postponement of aging manifestations. For example, the United States started adding vitamin D to milk and some other dairy products since the 1930s because of the high prevalence of rickets and osteomalacia in northern climates at that time. We know now that vitamin D supplementation, along with calcium in milk, also reduces the risk of bone fractures in elderly women through amelioration of osteoporosis. Another possible contributing factor to remarkable postponing of aging may be the historical decline in disease in early life. Facts are accumulating to suggest that many diseases and disabilities of older age have their roots in previous exposures to infectious agents when younger. For example, chronic inflammation common to many infectious diseases is related to the later onset of arthritis, atherosclerosis, diabetes, Alzheimer\\'s disease and cancer. Perhaps with improved sanitation, antibiotics and immune response through better nutrition and vaccination, the late-life debilitating effects of early-life infections have been partially ameliorated. In short, many people have expected that a cure for aging may come in the form of a magic pill (an anti-aging drug of some sort). Nothing of the sort has happened of course. Instead, we have largely overlooked real and continuing progress in slowing the effects of aging, precisely because this progress has been so unanticipated and gradual. For how long will this historical trend of aging amelioration continue? How far will it go? Can this beneficial process be accelerated? These are good questions to study alongside and in addition to the traditional search for anti-aging drugs. My personal view is that future generations may be puzzled as to why we overlooked some simple and readily available medicine and technology, while spending so much time and money on expensive, complex dead-end projects. This is like sequencing the entire DNA sequence for scurvy patients instead of simply giving them a lemon... Of course, aging is not as simple as scurvy. The most likely scenario for the future is a set of partial successes instead of one breakthrough. We need to understand the historical trends in amelioration of aging and try to accelerate it. Perhaps we need to pay more attention to latent infections in early life, prevention of conditions leading to inflammation and radically change the whole culture of human nutrition. For example, encouraging accomplishments in smoking prevention in the United States gives some hope that perhaps similar efforts could be applied to the obesity epidemic in this country. Food which is high in vitamins, important minerals, micronutrients and fiber content, while being low in calories and animal fat may have a profound effect on further postponement of age-related degenerative diseases in later life. Research into calorie restriction offers confirming evidence for this supposition. To summarize, we can now speak about a significant plasticity of aging rather than the old concept of immutable aging. In other words, aging effects can be altered and postponed. By acknowledging this, I do not wish to undermine the importance of future possible pharmacological medicines and technology and other promising approaches that include gene and stem cell therapy. On the contrary, these new experimental approaches may have a bright future, because even much simpler approaches do work! The Current State of Aging Research The current state of aging research is paradoxical. On the one hand, we hear about new exciting discoveries every month in the mass media. This creates the impression that aging studies are flourishing now. What we do not hear in the news are the many research opportunities lost due to insufficient funding and how desperate scientists have become in their attempts to secure funding for aging research. Currently only 10-20% of aging research projects are funded: most promising projects cannot even get started. Much more generous funding of aging research is a key issue now, if we really wish to improve on current research efforts to understand and intervene in human aging. Consider our research team, for example. We must currently spend more than a half of our professional time on paperwork just to obtain research funding: submission of proposals, revision in response to review comments and re-submission of the revised proposals is repeated over and over again! What a wastage of precious professional time, which could be used much more productively for research work itself! Our contacts with colleagues confirm that our situation is not unique. The waste of professional time and effort on paperwork is really quite alarming. By now, our team has three promising research projects on aging and longevity studies, all of which belong to the \"high risk - high gain\" category, and therefore have no chance to be funded in a regular way. We would be delighted to pass these projects for consideration of private philanthropists like Bill Gates or George Soros, should they ever choose to support aging studies. With the support of private foundations (such the MacArthur Foundation), so many interesting and important projects on aging could be accomplished! A radical improvement of the aging research funding is urgently needed if we wish to use the full creative potential of researchers, instead of wasting their time on paperwork. Promising Avenues of Research If we are interested in extension of healthy lifespan in humans, not just in fruit flies, then perhaps we need to pay more attention to human studies. If we wish to study humans and their lifespan, we must overcome two obstacles. Firstly, the opportunities for experiments that involve humans are limited. Secondly, studies on human lifespan may take too long a time to wait for answers. Both problems could be resolved through epidemiological and biodemographic studies of human longevity. In other words, we collect and analyse data from experiments which Mother Nature has already performed with humans. This is the quantitative analysis of historical and genealogical data on human longevity, and it seems to be an extremely promising approach. These kinds of studies may provide us with new and important knowledge in a very short period of time. These are not just words -- we have already developed a detailed research project for particularly promising avenues of research and even published it in the Journal of Anti-Aging Medicine as an article entitled \"Epidemiology of human longevity: The search for appropriate methodology.\" (JAAM, 2001, 4(1): 13-30). This project could provide us with a decisive knowledge on the mechanisms of human longevity in just 5 years. The major obstacle in commencing this research is of course the lack of funding... How do we know that these avenues of research are really promising? Well, we have already made some amazing preliminary findings. For example, we found a very unusual pattern of human lifespan inheritance. Traditionally, it was assumed that familial transmission of human lifespan from parents to children should follow a linear relationship. This is common to all other quantitative traits. In other words, each additional year of parental lifespan would be expected to provide the children with some fixed gain in average lifespan too. Quite contrary to these conventional expectations, we discovered a very different, threshold pattern of lifespan inheritance. There is no lifespan heritability if parental lifespan is below a threshold age of 75-85 years. There is a very strong heritability of human lifespan if parents live longer lives. These amazing preliminary findings are published as an article \"When does human longevity start?: Demarcation of the boundaries for human longevity\" in the Journal of Anti-Aging Medicine (JAAM, 2001, 4(2): 115-124). We also found that early circumstances of human life (such as the month of birth) may have a profound effect 30 years later on the chances of survival. This is also quite remarkable. This finding indicates that there may have been critical periods early in human development that are particularly sensitive to historical seasonal variations in living conditions (seasonal vitamin deficiencies or seasonal exposure to pathogens, and so forth). We published an article \"Season of Birth and Human Longevity\" in Journal of Anti-Aging Medicine (JAAM, 1999, 2(4): 365-366) on this exciting topic and recently reconfirmed our initial findings on larger datasets. Another promising avenue of research is related to our finding that paternal age at person\\'s conception may be an important predictor of lifespan. This finding suggests that the mutation load or other genetic damage in paternal sperm cells may play a significant role in determining the length of human life. Thus there are many exciting and promising avenues for future research. The only problem is in obtaining sufficient funding to accomplish them! Obstacles For Anti-Aging Medicine The most important current obstacle to anti-aging medicine is public confusion on the exact meaning and scientific credibility of anti-aging medicine. This confusion is reflected in the title of the recent scientific article \"Is There an Antiaging Medicine?\" published by the Journal of Gerontology (2002, volume 57A, number 9, pp. B333-B338). The term \"anti-aging medicine\" is currently used by three disparate groups of people in three completely different ways: this is the root cause of confusion. First, there is a large group of scientists who publish their research findings in the Journal of Anti-Aging Medicine and other related peer-reviewed scientific journals. For them, anti-aging medicine is the ultimate goal of their research work. It is future medicine and technology aimed at controlling the aging process by postponing, delaying, preventing and even reversing the deleterious effects of aging. By now, over a hundred important research articles have been published in the Journal of Anti-Aging Medicine. These articles are actively cited and used by the international scientific community. If you make a search of scientific literature for the term \"anti-aging\" you will find that this term is routinely used now (like the terms \"antioxidant\" or \"antibiotic\", for example) in the texts of scientific articles, their abstracts, key words, and even titles. I have recently performed an analysis of the scientific literature and published these findings in the form of an article with a suitably self-explanatory title: \"Scientific Legitimacy of the Term \\'Anti-Aging.\\'\" (Journal of Anti-Aging Medicine, 2002, 5(2): 239-240.). This article contains the list of legitimate anti-aging studies published in reputable journals by established researchers which use the term \"anti-aging\". The second group of people who use the term \"anti-aging medicine\" are a class of medical practitioners. They are confronted with the real and often urgent health needs of their aged patients. For these physicians, \"anti-aging medicine\" is the everyday practice, often by trial and error, of alleviating, postponing, and hopefully even preventing or reversing some detrimental effects of aging. These practitioners are a rather diverse group. Some of their activities are in fact very useful, such as the early detection and treatment of conditions that contribute to the accelerated progress of age-related degenerative diseases. For example the early detection and treatment of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, latent chronic infections, chronic inflammation, obesity, and vitamin or micronutrient deficiencies may postpone the onset of many detrimental effects of aging. However, commercialization of the anti-aging industry has brought advertisement hype and spam. In some cases there is even a distinct smell of quackery and fraud. Unfortunately these marginal \"anti-aging\" groups are particularly noisy in their excessive advertisements. They are discrediting the very notion of anti-aging medicine in their efforts to make money. Finally, there is a third group of people who believe that anti-aging interventions are neither possible nor desirable. They consider anti-aging medicine as \"tampering with aging,\" which is both immoral and futile in their opinion. For them, \"if it\\'s \\'anti-aging\\' it\\'s quackery by definition\" (Science, 2002, 295, page 1033). They select the most ridiculous and marginal cases of \"anti-aging\" quackery and expose them to the public, as if these cases are representative of anti-aging studies and anti-aging medicine. How these obstacles to anti-aging medicine best be overcome ? Quite simply, we need to widely and effectively educate the public and even portions of the scientific community on the existence of legitimate anti-aging science with its legitimate goal of developing the foundations for future anti-aging medicine. This educational work is already in progress. For example, the journal \"Science\" has recently published our consensus letter \"Antiaging technology and pseudoscience\", signed by Dr. Michael Fossel, the Editor-in-Chief for the Journal of Anti-Aging Medicine and by some other Editorial Board members of this journal, including myself. This publication did receive significant attention and initiated an interesting discussion published in Science online. In this letter we clearly spelled out the difference between the scientific, peer-reviewed Journal of Anti-Aging Medicine, and the popular magazines that currently serve as advertisements for the anti-aging industry. Still, a great deal more needs to be done to obtain wider support and recognition for anti-aging medicine as a legitimate goal of scientific research. To address this issue, a year ago we established a scientific and educational website entitled \"Unraveling the Secrets of Human Longevity\". I would urge other researchers to join our efforts and contribute to the further development of anti-aging medicine by spreading the word! Taking Up a Career in Aging Research First, I would like to welcome new researchers and congratulate them for the choice they have made. Aging and longevity studies are so obviously important that they will provide a sense of purpose to your life and inspiration for further research. My advice for researchers can be summarized in the following way: 1. Keep sight of the big picture and a broad vision of the problem. In aging studies there is always the risk of being overwhelmed and distracted by details. There is also a temptation to adopt fancy new techniques at the expense of the initial goals of research. You may find yourself missing the forest for the trees, trying to read a newspaper through an electron microscope or otherwise getting trapped in details. For example, there is current great interest in the study of differential gene expression during aging. However, aging may also be related to a simple decrease in the number of cells over time (a loss of failsafe redundancy in the body, in other words). You could overlook this important possibility while concentrating on detailed, fancy techniques. 2. Be persistent in your research efforts and prepared for occasional failure. Scientific research is always at risk of failure. It is an exploration of unknown areas, often by trial and error. Therefore, consider failure not as an indicator of your research performance, but rather as a signal telling you to choose alternative research tactics. Remember that aging studies are important. This will protect you from periods of frustration during occasional scientific failure. If you have a sense of the importance of your research work, you will find the strength to start again. You must also be prepared for the failure to fund your research proposals. Here again, be responsive to criticism and change your tactics, but always be persistent in these strategic money matters. 3. Use the data-driven approach, instead of following a doctrine. Theories of aging are very important. They allow us to organize accumulated facts into a comprehensive body of knowledge and plan further research. Yet researchers all too often become hostages of their own theories, falling into the trap of \"adapting\" facts to fit their concepts. I advise treating aging theories a set of speculations or ideas that require further elaboration and validation. Keep an open mind and a critical vision. For any statement, claim or reported finding, one should seek alternative opinions and listen to their arguments carefully. Make final conclusions yourself, based on substance and facts rather than the apparent credibility of the sources. Famed authors and publications in prestigious scientific journals (on glossy paper!) may still be wrong. Be aware of conflicts of interests (follow the money that may produce deceptive claims). In difficult situations, rely on your common sense and choose outcomes that enable you to keep your peace of mind. The Future of Aging and Anti-Aging Medicine It is extremely important for researchers to understand the following: It is up to us to bring about a revolution in life extension medicine! If we convince ourselves and the public that nothing can or should be done with aging, this pronoucement will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. We will have thrown away the chance for longer, healthier lives for everyone. In the past, the commitment of this nation has led to the completion of fantastic projects such as the flight to the Moon. Why should we consider this generation any less capable of great achievements? One such achievement could be the advent of practical, cheap, widely-available anti-aging medicine and technology. The main challenge to accomplishing a revolution in life extension medicine and technology lies in the mobilization of national and public support for relevant research projects. From this perspective, recent attempts to discredit anti-aging research efforts and present them as a kind of scientific pornography should be taken very seriously indeed. In my opinion, these attempts should not be endorsed. Moreover, it would be very useful to establish a prestigious Anti-Aging Science Award in order to stimulate legitimate anti-aging scientific studies and the public support for these activities. Anti-aging research projects will require large-scale and long-term intervention trials with human subjects. This will be very expensive and will require careful governmental supervision to minimize health risks. In other words, this ambitious anti-aging project would require mobilization of the nation and public support -- just as happened for the Apollo program and the flight to the Moon. One man cannot get to the Moon by collecting rocket fuel in his apartment, and one researcher cannot singlehandedly revolutionize anti-aging medicine. A grand anti-aging project may even require the joint efforts of many nations, and this ambitious collaborative project may help to bring many nations together. Mankind has already seen the positive results of international scientific collaboration in many fields. Large anti-aging projects may help to further strengthen cooperation between nations. With all this in mind, I believe it is important to bring the issue of aging prevention to the center of public debates now. By the next presidential elections, it could become a key political issue. We should not lose this opportunity to loudly express our opinions on anti-aging studies in public, and clearly make our supporting arguments heard. In accomplishing this, we can help to build the future that we deserve. About the Author Dr. Leonid Gavrilov obtained a Masters degree in chemistry (chemical kinetics and enzymology) and a Ph.D. in biology (genetics), both from Moscow State University, Russia. He then spent a decade of intensive research and self-education, writing a book \"The Biology of Life Span\" in conjunction with his wife Dr. Gavrilova, published in the United States in 1991. \"The Biology of Life Span\" is selected and cited by the Encyclopaedia Britannica as a recommended reference on longevity. The book received positive reviews in a dozen scientific journals, including Nature, the British Medical Journal and BioEssays. It has been cited more than a hundred times in scientific literature. Dr. Gavrilov is a recipient (Principal Investigator) of the Independent Scientist Award from the National Institute on Aging, NIH. He and his wife have recently developed and published a new unifying theory of aging and longevity based on reliability theory. This new theory provides a general explanation of aging for organisms as well as technical devices. It was published by the Journal of Theoretical Biology and received media attention (including the journal \"The Scientist\"). Dr. Gavrilov has developed a course \"Biodemography of Human Mortality and Longevity,\" and teaches at the University of Chicago. His recent scientific article \"Evolutionary Theories of Aging and Longevity\" was written and published largely thanks to teaching activities. Dr. Gavrilov currently works at the Center on Aging, NORC/ University of Chicago.', 'start_index': 29661}, page_content='research proposals.

Be aware'), Document(metadata={'publish_date': '2012-05-25', 'body': 'I view the world of aging and longevity science as divided into three broad classes of research and researchers - something that will already be apparent to regular readers, but which I don\\'t recall having outlined explicitly. This crude model of the research community informs the ways in which I read research and evaluate the state of progress towards meaningful goals: both extension of healthy human life, and - more importantly - forms of medicine capable of repair and reversal of aging. Class 1: Investigating Aging By far the largest component of the aging science community is made up of researchers who are not working on ways to alter or repair the aging process. They investigate only, and thus the majority of funds devoted to the science of aging still go towards studies that aim to make no difference to the world beyond gathering data. This group include most of those who run demographic studies of human longevity, for example. Aging research is unusual in the medically-relevant life sciences by virtue of this preponderance of \"look but don\\'t touch.\" Up until comparatively recently it was extremely hard to find funding or respect for work that aimed to do more than gather data on aging; the scientific community worked to exclude those who had such goals in mind, and funding sources closed their doors to anyone known to harbor heretical thoughts about extending human life through biotechnology. Class 2: Working to Slow Aging The larger minority class in aging research is made up of researchers and funding institutions who are working towards ways to slow aging, or working on related areas that will be used in constructing therapies to slow aging. The typical approach here is to reverse engineering the genetic and other low-level biochemical roots of known differences in longevity (such as the effects of calorie restriction , or the differences in life span between similar species ), and then try to reproduce some of those differences using drugs, gene therapies, and other similar means. The view of these researchers is largely that we are a long way from any practical results, and those results will only offer incremental gains - a viewpoint I agree with . Nonetheless, this class is where much of the energy and vigor is in funding and growth for aging research. This may be because this general research strategy is easily understood by traditional sources of funding, and is only an incremental alteration to previous forms of old-school drug development work. The sea change in the aging research community over the past decade or so has largely manifested as a transformation of researchers from the bulk of class 1 into up and coming enthusiasts of class 2. As it became respectable to talk about doing something about aging - thanks to the hard work of a comparatively small number of advocates and visionary scientists - there has been a steady shifting of research priorities. The investigators still outnumber research groups working on ways to alter the course of aging, but the trend is clearly towards a field that develops clinical applications in medicine rather than only informing the medical profession of what to expect in their patients. Class 3: Working to Reverse Aging The smallest and most important cohort of researchers are those who are working on ways to repair, reverse, or work around the root causes of aging - the SENS Foundation research network being the archetype, though not the only set of researchers and laboratories involved in this work. This class are the most important because their approach is the only viable path we can see that has a good chance of producing rejuvenation biotechnology capable of greatly extending healthy life in the elderly - through restoring youthful function and vigor. This is the smallest cohort because we do not live in a particularly rational world. I have discussed in the past why it is that repair based strategies are so very much better than approaches based on slowing down aging. The short of it is that aging is a matter of damage : slowing down the pace of damage will do little for people who are already old, while repairing damage will be beneficial to everyone. You can only achieve rejuvenation through actual repair, not by slowing down the rust. Given that the cost of producing therapies from the two very different strategic approaches to medicine for aging will likely be in the same ballpark, we should evidently aim for the better outcome. There is also the matter of time - it will be decades before either side of the house has a mature base of therapies in place, and by the time those therapies are available those of use with the greatest vested interest in using them will be old. So only the strategy of aiming for rejuvenation offers the chance of an outcome that grants additional decades at the end of the day - enough time to push past actuarial escape velocity and thus be able to wait out the advent of even better therapies. But cogent arguments aside, the greatest growth in aging research is still amongst class 2, those working on the slow road to a poor end result. Now that the research community is essentially persuaded to the view that work on aging is good, interesting, and plausible, the next - and equally important - goal of advocacy is to persuade a great many more researchers to work on the SENS vision for rejuvenation biotechnology or equivalent scientific programs. Many, many lives depend on it.', 'url': 'https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2012/05/the-three-types-of-research-into-aging-and-longevity/', 'title': 'The Three Types of Research into Aging and Longevity', 'start_index': 3262}, page_content='3: Working to Reverse Aging The smallest and most important cohort of researchers are those who are working on ways to repair, reverse, or work around the root causes of aging - the SENS Foundation research network being the archetype, though not the only set of researchers and laboratories involved in this work.

You can only'), Document(metadata={'body': 'Today I thought I\\'d point out a couple of interesting papers on the work of finding drugs to intervene in the aging process. This is far from a widespread undertaking, even now that more funding is arriving into the field. The majority of researchers focused on aging are not looking to intervene in the aging process at all, and their work is purely investigative. Equally, the majority of research into age-related disease is focused on working backwards from the disarray of a diseased metabolism, tracing molecular links in long chains of cause and effect that hopefully lead closer to causes rather than dead ends. At each new discovery, some groups stop to develop therapies, screening for drugs that can influence the newly uncovered link in a beneficial way, while causing few enough side-effects to be acceptable. Preference is typically given to existing drugs, even if they are much less effective than a theoretical new drug, because it is less expensive to push that through the regulatory system . The nature of this approach means that the resulting therapies largely involve tinkering with an already complex, failed metabolic state, without addressing the root causes of that failure, and are therefore only marginally effective. This is the story of most medical research: expensive drug development, massive regulatory costs, perverse incentives to create less effective treatments, and tiny gains at the end of the day. There is a completely different approach to the problem of age-related disease, however, which is to start from the beginning and the known root causes of aging , and try to repair and revert these causes prior to a full understanding of the chain of cause and effect that drives the progression of aging. Don\\'t try to work forward to full understanding of the process, just fix things where there is compelling evidence for their involvement in aging and see what happens. This should be much less challenging than the mainstream approach of working backwards from the disease state, and should produce far better results. It should also answer many questions as to the root causes of specific age-related diseases, and far more efficiently than working backwards through the complexity of late stage disease. How do researchers know what the root causes of aging are with such great reliability? Over the years, many, many research groups have compared old tissue and young tissue , and ruled out everything that has a direct cause other than the operation of normal metabolic processes. What is left is a consensus list of side-effects and molecular damage, the fundamental changes that are produced in the cells of normal, healthy, young individuals, and that slowly turn them into aged, diseased, and ultimately dead individuals. Unfortunately this better approach of repair has yet to gain more than a foothold in the research community. There is a long way to go yet before we can call rejuvenation research a mainstream, well-funded concern. If you look through the SENS rejuvenation research programs , it is clear that there is a role for traditional or more modern drug discovery and development in a number of areas. There may prove to be good enough drug-based approaches to senescent cell clearance , for example, to compete in the marketplace with the more efficient and directed gene therapy techniques pioneered by Oisin Biotechnologies . Work on breaking down glucosepane cross-links will also no doubt settle down to some form of drug development once an initial class of compounds shows effectiveness. There are other examples, such as the work of Pentraxin Therapeutics or Human Rejuvenation Technologies that are both fairly standard issue drug development and relevant to the SENS vision. So all in all, I think you\\'ll find the open access papers below interesting, even if they have little to say in and of themselves on the topic of rejuvenation research, being more focused on methods of altering metabolism to slightly slow aging . Finding Ponce de Leon\\'s Pill: Challenges in Screening for Anti-Aging Molecules Several drugs have demonstrated great promise in the laboratory setting in enhancing the healthspan and lifespan of multiple species, including mice, raising the possibility that efficacious pharmacologic anti-aging therapy in people may be possible. However, screening for novel small molecules with anti-aging effects in mammals in an unbiased fashion represents an enormous, potentially insurmountable challenge. Alternatively, since it is clear that several cellular pathways affect longevity in an evolutionarily conserved manner, invertebrate models may be quite useful for such screening endeavors. However, some known molecular factors with major effects on mammalian lifespan are not well conserved between invertebrates and mammals. Consequently, small molecule screening efforts relying exclusively on the use of invertebrates will likely miss drugs with potent effects on mammalian aging. Moreover, many of the key physiologic features of humans and other mammals are not well modeled in invertebrates, as the latter lack specific tissues like heart and kidney and complex endocrine , nervous , and circulatory systems that are crucial targets of mammalian aging and age-related pathologies. Most invertebrate aging models possess limited regenerative capabilities and incompletely recapitulate processes such as stem cell renewal , which are required for tissue repair mechanisms that maintain tissue homeostasis in mammals, in order to sustain organ function over years and decades. To date, the discovery of anti-aging compounds has so far been carried out via two basic approaches. One of these is phenotypic , defined as the screening of compounds in cellular or animal models to identify drugs conferring desired biological effects, i.e. lifespan extension. Although this approach has proven enormously valuable in many areas of biochemical research, identifying drugs that can modulate lifespan is more time consuming, complex, and expensive than for many other phenotypes . Moreover, elucidating the mechanism of action of agents identified in such phenotypic, \"black box\" screens represents a formidable challenge, though the powerful genetic tools available in invertebrate models can facilitate such efforts. A complementary approach involves target-based screening for modulators of pathways known or strongly suspected to modulate the aging rate. However, by definition, such efforts are unlikely to identify novel cellular factors and pathways involved in longevity. A related challenge in aging research at present is the lack of primate model systems with reasonably short lifespan for preclinical testing of candidate anti-aging drugs. The most commonly used model, the rhesus monkey , lives for three to four decades. In Europe, the marmoset is used as a non-rodent species for drug safety assessment and toxicology. However, their maximal lifespan is ~17 years - shorter than the rhesus monkey, but still highly impractical for testing pharmacological interventions aimed at extending longevity. The development of new mammalian aging models besides the mouse would be extremely helpful to better elucidate the biological processes underlying mammalian aging and to expedite the translation of pharmacological interventions from the laboratory to actual clinical use in humans. One model to consider in this regard is dogs , which share their social environment with humans. Furthermore, dogs are relatively well understood with regard to aging and disease, exhibit great heterogeneity in body size and lifespan, and provide a large pool of genetic diversity. Testing candidate anti-aging compounds in humans represents an enormous challenge. It is highly unlikely that pharmaceutical companies can be persuaded to engage in decades-long clinical trials of candidate anti-aging medicines with lifespan as an endpoint. The evaluation of shorter-term surrogate phenotypes , such as molecular markers or age-associated defects such as impaired responses to vaccination, may permit initial clinical evaluation of candidate anti-aging compounds in a more reasonable timeframe. Biology of Healthy Aging and Longevity As a heterogeneous process, aging may occur at different rates across diverse organisms, and even organisms of the same species can age at variable rates. At the biological level, aging is characterized by the accumulation of molecular and cellular damage , which leads to structural and functional aberrancies in cells and tissues, such as loss of mitochondrial homeostasis , impaired intercellular communication, senescence (cell arrest that hampers growth and division), and decreased regenerative capacity . The ability of organisms to overcome stress and respond to external environmental challenges/insults is blunted within aged individuals when compared to younger counterparts. Healthy aging, however, refers to the warding off of molecular and cellular decline for the longest length of the lifespan. Not surprisingly, healthy aging has been associated with increased longevity. This claim is substantiated by the fact that genetic, dietary, and/or pharmacological interventions that promote cellular homoeostasis, stress resistance, and protection against age-related diseases also tend to extend lifespan and vice versa. Overwhelming scientific evidence supports the claim that there is no single cause of aging. Indeed, notable advancements in the biology of aging, especially during the last few decades, have contributed to the identification of multiple mechanisms that modulate the aging process. Despite this progress, uncovering interventions that can achieve healthy aging in humans is challenging. The conserved molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie aging, especially how these pathways interplay and how complex lifestyles and environments to which humans are exposed modify them, are not completely understood. Despite the impressive advancements made towards understanding more about the molecular basis of aging, there is still no definitive intervention for ensuring healthy aging in humans. To uncover new therapeutic avenues, we need to gain deeper knowledge about how different internal and external factors regulate the cellular hallmarks of aging, and how their regulation changes across time and individuals. All molecular pathways exhibit complex communication known as \" crosstalk .\" The genome , epigenome , organelles , proteome , and pathways such as those involving sirtuins , mTOR , AMPK , and insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling - all integrate and process signals that must act coordinately to promote homeostasis in cells and tissues. It is unclear, however, how these complex molecular networks are affected by diverse environmental challenges and how they become impaired with aging. Lastly, in an effort to find beneficial interventions to delay aging-linked deterioration, the search for small molecules that can mimic calorie restriction - and the dissection of their pharmacological modes of action in vivo - is a growing area of research that merits more attention. Collectively, through all of these scientific efforts, we may someday achieve the longstanding human dream of living a long and healthy life.', 'publish_date': '2016-04-22', 'title': 'The Small Molecule View: Searching for Drugs to Slow Aging', 'url': 'https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2016/04/the-small-molecule-view-searching-for-drugs-to-slow-aging/', 'start_index': 1641}, page_content=\"root causes of aging , and try to repair and revert these causes prior to a full understanding of the chain of cause and effect that drives the progression of aging.

Telomere length is a part of the clock mechanism limiting the life span of ordinary cells , and it decreases with each cell division. Telomerase is active in different tissues to different degrees, most notably in the stem cells that provide fresh cells with long telomeres to maintain tissues. The mix of these dynamics helps to determine the rate of cell turnover in any given tissue and the current average length of telomeres. This turnover rate varies greatly throughout the body, from a few days for the lining of the gut to essentially never for some of the central nervous system . The average length of telomeres tends to decline with aging or ill health, most likely due to a slowdown in the activity of stem cells and their delivery of new cells with long telomeres. As such these measures are probably a secondary aspect of aging, a marker rather than a root cause. That said, increasing telomerase activity in mice has been shown to extend life , though there are several plausible reasons why this might be the case, only one of which involves enhanced tissue function due to longer-lived cells. The potential upside here has to be balanced with a concern over cancer: forcing cells into longer lives than evolution has settled on may or may not tip the balance in favor of much more cancer. This hasn\\'t happened in the mouse studies, but mice have quite different telomere dynamics in comparison to humans. Michael Fossel is one of the more noteworthy advocates for telomerase therapy as an important research direction for the treatment of aging. Here is an interview: Michael Fossel\\'s dream is to reverse human aging and since 1996 he has been a strong and vocal advocate of experimenting with telomerase therapy as a potential way of intervention in a wide variety of medical conditions related to aging. During our 1 hour discussion with Michael we cover a variety of interesting topics such as: his dream to reverse aging and the desirability and feasibility thereof; the Hayflick limit of cell division and Aubrey de Grey\\'s concerns that telomerase therapy may cause cancer; the distinction between reversing aging and living forever; his \"non-sexy\" tips on healthy living; his take on cryonics and transhumanism . \"Ageing is dynamic, not static.

In other words, researchers are already working on the problems ( although often without explicitly working on \"curing\" aging ) and none of the problems appear to be impossible to solve! There is a very human desire to minimize disappointment.  Almost everyone at one time or another has fantasized about living forever.  Human beings from time immemorial have searched for the Fountain of Youth.  To imagine we could actually be approaching such a resolution would be too painful for many; the possibility would be rejected as preferable to having hopes dashed.  Yet by building on the life\\'s work of  the brilliant and persistent men and women of the last 500 years, we are indeed approaching the threshold of astounding advances in all areas of information technology and biology is increasingly becoming an information science. ... it occurred to me that all of these great men and women who came before me died too soon, their work unfinished.  I suspect most of us, even now the beneficiaries of anti-aging science (after all, what are anti-hypertensives and statins, if not anti-aging medications) do not wish to suffer the same way.  No one wants to die with their work here unfinished. Very true. The search for longevity is the quest to give people a choice presently lacking - to live another day, and take on the next challenge, should you so desire. Aging is no different than any other limit imposed upon us by the accidents of fate and evolution: we will overcome it, as we have overcome so many other limitations of the human condition of ages past, and remember the tragedy of those who had to live and die before that milestone was achieved. Moving on, I\\'m pleased to note that the folk at the Speculist are enjoying their copies : Phil got his hands on an advanced copy and has promised a review. ... This is the book that those of us who have followed life extension closely have been eagerly awaiting. ... You must get this book. Economist Arnold Kling is threatening a review : I just finished Aubrey de Grey\\'s Ending Aging. I think that anyone who likes reading science books for pleasure would enjoy it. I\\'ll have more to say later. Finally, a piece on Aubrey de Grey and Ending Aging from the Daily Galaxy : Like Francis Bacon, de Grey has never stationed himself at a laboratory bench to attempt a \\xadsingle hands-on experiment, at least not in human biology.  He is a computer scientist who has taught himself natural science, and has set himself toward the goal of transforming the basis of what it means to be human. Dr. de Grey, who holds a rare University of Cambridge degree on this basis of publications rather than classwork, believes that the key biomedical technology required to eliminate aging-derived debilitation and death entirely is now within reach - technology that would not only slow but periodically reverse age-related physiological decay, leaving us biologically young into an indefinite future. De Grey is an administrative and theoretical scientist; he has formulated the Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senesence , published extensively in scientific journals, is editor-in-chief for for the journal Rejuvenation Research , speaks at conferences around the world, and presently directs research aimed at repairing aging through the Methuselah Foundation and in collaborative work with biomedical researchers. More pertinently, he is the epitome of direct action: starting from scratch, he has made himself into a force for change in aging research and, by extension, all our futures. Get out there and buy the book in which Aubrey de Grey and Michael Rae explain, as best we know based on the biotechnology and scientific knowledge of today, how we can band together, build a mighty research infrastructure, and greatly extend our healthy life spans soon enough to matter.

Innocuous or not, it still contains a fair dose of utter nonsense mixed in with its view of the field, as is fairly standard for this sort of thing. Professional bioethics, it has to be said, has done little to make itself useful in the past generation in my view, and in fact has used regulation to slow progress in those areas where bioethicists have attracted the most attention. It is a corruption of the older, actually useful field of medical ethics , which had the merits of being simple, valuable, and requiring little upkeep. Bioethics, on the other hand, has become a cancerous political institution, ever growing, and its practitioners ever incentivized to justify their budgets by making up obstacles where none actually exist. Geroscience , also called biogerontology , is a field of research that is exploring the biological processes that underlie ageing. Researchers working in this field believe that intervening in these processes could be a more efficient way of increasing health span - the number of years we are healthy - than tackling each condition individually. Recent advances in the tools of research are likely to accelerate our understanding of ageing processes in the near future. Compressing the period of poor health experienced by many in old age could have a transformative effect on the lives of older people and is widely considered to be the primary goal of geroscience research. Biomedical interventions, along with environmental, social and lifestyle modifications, have already contributed to the extension of human lifespan. Depending on other factors that could affect lifespan, ageing interventions could lead to a further delaying of death. Some suggest that a realistic target of geroscience research is to delay all ageing-related disorders by about seven years . Other commentators believe that scientific advances will lead to much more radical effects on ageing and human lifespan in the near future. There are differences of opinion about the value and morality of extending lifespan, even moderately. Some philosophers believe that we think of our lives as having a certain shape, which underpins how long we think people should work and how long it is appropriate to be old. Increased longevity therefore might threaten the shape we envisage for our lives and our sense of personal identity. The benefits of experiencing the pleasures of life over a longer time period are used by some to justify life extension; others argue it is quality not quantity of years that matters. Some equate extending life with saving lives, and suggest there is a strong moral imperative to pursue treatment for disease, even if the side effect is an increase in lifespan. A common concern of lifespan extension is that it would accelerate population growth , and that this would have a range of adverse consequences, particularly for the environment. However, one study suggests that population changes would be surprisingly slow in response to even a dramatic extension of lifespan and would not necessarily lead to overpopulation. It has also been argued that using finite resources in a nonsustainable manner is a problem that needs to be solved independently of how long people live. Estimations of the impact of increasing health span on the economy are generally positive. For example, one analysis suggests increasing human health span would reduce healthcare spending and lead to significant economic savings . Another suggests that delayed ageing could mean increases in social benefit and public healthcare costs, but that these would be far outweighed by economic gains as a result of a healthier workforce who remain employed for longer and are given more time to save for retirement. These effects would depend on the relative increases in health span and lifespan that could be achieved by ageing interventions, which currently are highly uncertain. Ageing interventions are likely to be available only through the private sector initially. As with any paid for therapy, it is probable that access to ageing interventions will be unequal , leading to an exacerbation of existing health inequalities according to income, socioeconomic status, and geography. In addition, personal choices about uptake of ageing interventions could have implications for entitlement to state care and health insurance. There are calls for government policies to ensure unequal access to ageing interventions is avoided. Global health inequalities present particular challenges in this context, given that the citizens of some countries still have low life expectancies owing to poor sanitation, nutrition, and healthcare provision. The duties of developed countries to put efforts into addressing these problems, in relation to the efforts put into research on ageing interventions, require consideration. Some argue that the focus on finding medical treatments for ageing is unhelpful, in that it suggests ageing is a problem that requires fixing and reinforces negative views of ageing. There are parallels with how the medical community view frailty . Frailty is commonly regarded as a state of overall poor health, weakness and vulnerability, but diagnosing people with frailty may serve to marginalise them from society and unfairly label people as being destined to decline. There is also concern that other important elements of successful ageing , such as personal relationships, social position, physical environment and independence, are side-lined by geroscientists. An important question for geroscience research is whether potential interventions should be tested in younger people, before biological ageing has started, or in older adults already experiencing symptoms of ageing. In the past, involving older adults in research was thought to be difficult and of no benefit to them. This view has broadly changed. The challenges of research have been found to be much the same whatever the age of the participant, and medical interventions in people aged over 80 can have beneficial effects on their health. In addition, 'older adults' are a diverse group and generalisations about people's ability and willingness to take part in research should be avoided.

I briefly escaped from the conference for an ad hoc, unstructured discussion with Adam Ford of Science, Technology, and the Future , who, like the Life Extension Advocacy Foundation folk, was interviewing as many people as he could during the event. It wound up a monologue on topics that were at the top of my mind at the time, particularly the present state of funding and the transformation of our community from a primary focus on advocacy and academic research to one in which a great deal of important work is now carried out in startup companies, and the utilitarian ethics of treating aging as a medical condition. The resulting video is now up at YouTube, and is here accompanied by a transcript for those who prefer text. I\\'m Reason. I\\'ve been around in this community for quite the long time, going on I guess twenty years now, rather shockingly. I seem to have become old in my own lifetime; I\\'m not as young as I look, unfortunately. I run Fight Aging! , the blog, which I\\'ve used as a platform for advocacy for some time, the aforementioned going on twenty years, though more like fifteen now for that site. Recently, last year, I cofounded Repair Biotechnologies with Bill Cherman to actually jump into the industry and do some things. Prior to that I was investing as an angel in a few biotech startups focused on aging, where I felt it was a better choice than giving to the SENS Research Foundation or other groups to do the research, because companies have the chance to attract a great deal more funding more rapidly than non-profits do, unfortunately - that is just the way of the world. That is very much the transition of our community right now. And as that happens, I think it becomes much more important to think about why the hell are we doing this thing? Sudden influxes of vast amounts of funding are consequential. There are several hundred million dollar funds right now, focused on longevity , and there will be more next year, because it is a land rush right now. If you lose sight of why you are doing this, and thus what is the most effective approach, then you wind up with a bunch of idiots doing stupid things that won\\'t work, and the upshot of that is that funding will be wasted. It is to a certain degree unavoidable, I mean look at the dot com era; every new industry has its peak of hype, a bunch of stupid things happen, a bunch of charlatans come in and take funding from investors who don\\'t know any better. It will happen, but I think that those of us who are here now, and have been here in this community, have something of a duty to try to reduce the size of that problem, down to some nominal minimum, to the degree that that is possible to achieve. So why do we do this? The fundamental philosophy of the problem is that death is bad. Suffering is bad. That death is bad is the more debatable of those two. It is quite possible to construct an ethical position in which we say it is fine to be dead, you didn\\'t exist for quite a long time prior to existing, and you will not exist for quite a long time after you cease to exist. That is the way of the universe; the Stoics were good with this position. But I think it is very hard to argue that suffering is acceptable, at least above the sort of \"maybe I should get out of bed and do something today\" level of suffering needed to motivate the human animal to go and do something constructive. Anything much more than that level of angst I think should go away - and certainly that includes the level of pain, physical decrepitude, loss of function, and horrible things happening to the people around you that comes with aging. That should go away. The world just hasn\\'t quite got there yet in terms of thinking about this in the right way. People think about malaria in the right way. Malaria is something like one six hundredth of the cost to humanity of aging, depending on how you want to measure all the little fripperies around the edges. So if we really feel up in arms about malaria, willing to spend billions on getting rid of it, which some people clearly are, then we should be spending trillions on getting rid of aging. We should be, but we are not, and that is why the advocacy community came into being. We have this weird mismatch between our capabilities and our goals. The world is a crazy place, I think everyone acknowledges that; there are many, many insanities that the human condition contains, be that politics, be that the way that some people like peanut butter, pick your poison. The present relationship with aging is just another one of these insanities: the world is insane with respect to aging, because accepting aging is insane. Why would anybody accept that he or she is going to crumble and die, and not want to do something about it? Plain, basic utilitarianism says that we should do something about it if we can do something about it. And we can do something about it! So is the population of the world asleep at the switch because next to no-one realizes that we can do something about it? That will change pretty soon. Senolytics will wake up everybody. What if you can take one pill that makes your arthritis go away? That is basically what senolytics will do, when they are truly effective. The ones we have right now, that are available right now, appear to be fairly good at getting rid of arthritis, based on the results of trials yet to be published. Once this realization happens, I think there will be an interesting phase change. People will start to somewhat wake up from this business of \"oh well, aging is just a fact of life, wherein we\\'re all going to die horribly, let\\'s just get on and try to paper over that.\" So no, instead let us go full on utilitarian and try to do something about it. That is essentially the philosophy of action here. It is that aging is so terrible that there is really no amount of effort that humanity could spend on this problem that would be too great. Of course we\\'re so far away from anything that even approaches a reasonable amount of effort, given the level of death and suffering caused by aging , that for the foreseeable future we can keep on advocating and building hundred million dollar funds. If investors build another hundred of those hundred million dollar funds, that would be a nice start, but by no means the right amount of funding in order to reasonably address the problem, given what it actually costs. The cost is enormous, and, sadly, most discussions about aging, when they do get going, really skate over the utilitarianism of it in favor of \"wow, we\\'re spending a lot of money on entitlements, we need to do something about this .\" That latter expression seems to be what passes for ethical thought in policy circles these days. It is a matter of \"well, we\\'re spending a bunch of funds, we should find a way to stop doing that.\" Then of course, the nihilists seems to be mostly in charge now, because their idea of spending less is to not treat old people for their conditions , rather than building rejuvenation therapies that stop old people from getting those conditions. As I said, it is insanity. This really just needs to change. So this is why the advocacy, and now that we\\'re at the point at which funding can be raised for startup companies working on rejuvenation biotechnologies, these startups are just another form of advocacy, really, if you look at the bigger picture. We\\'re not building therapies because we can do something with our small slice of the pie of aging, we\\'re building therapies because if we show people that we can do something with our small slice of the pie of aging, then soon enough there will be another hundred companies over the next decade, working on their small slices. People will see success and attempt to replicate it themselves. There are a hundred, two hundred, three hundred programs out there languishing in the research community that could be turned into companies, turned into therapies, doing useful things in and around aging. As you know, the research community is just not good at raising funding. They are not good at translating their research to the clinic. They are poor at a lot of things other than just advancing the science. I think it falls to the rest of us, where \"the rest of us\" means anyone who might be an entrepreneur, or in the venture industry, or an advocate, to set forth and sift through these programs, the output of the scientific community, and say \"look, we should do something with these things.\" If the research community isn\\'t pushing a program forward, well, this is a time in which anyone can wrap a company around a project, say \"I think we can do something with this,\" go to the venture industry and get a few million dollars in seed funding. That will be the case for the next twenty years, on and off, as the market cycles up and down. So we should have a thousand startup companies working on a thousand projects related to aging. While there are only seven categories of fundamental causative damage, per SENS , some of those categories are very, very broad in terms of their little individual components. We have to fix all of lipofuscin , and we don\\'t even have a good catalog of everything that is in lipofuscin, just the major pieces of it. We have to get rid of all the amyloids , and that is a good few dozen projects right there. Replacing aged stem cells : a different cell population, different recipes for therapy for every tissue. And so on and so forth all the way down the list. Then after we\\'ve worked through the SENS list of causative damage as it exists today, there will be all the things about aging that are problematic but are hidden by the fact that people presently die before they become problematic. Such as nuclear pore proteins in long-lived neurons . Some of those molecules never change after they are initially created. It is the same molecule for your entire life, and if it gets damaged, well, that is kind of a problem. How do we build the nanotechnology to go fix our nuclear pore proteins? That is a problem that no-one should much care about today, because there are fifty other things that will kill you before that will become an issue. But it will become an issue, eventually. If we come to live to 150, I\\'m willing to believe that your nuclear pore proteins becoming corroded and corrupted and reacted with is actually a serious issue, at least in neurons . We can in principle replace everything except the brain. So the worst case scenario for the ultimate future is that they open your skull, take out your brain, and put it into a new body. I\\'m sure it will actually be somewhat more sophisticated than that, but this is just a thought experiment - what is the most radical thing you can make work in terms of replacement, in principle? That is moving the brain to a new body. What will probably happen instead is that your new body will be rebuilt from your old body: regeneration and rejuvenation by delivery of cells and therapies and control over cell behavior. But the brain itself? A really challenging problem, because you have to fix it without breaking it . I think we are along the way towards understanding the mechanisms to target for the early, preventative reductions in inflammation , to avoid supporting cells in the brain going crazy , to get rid of the protein aggregates . To try to keep things the way they were during your 30s. But that is just a starting point. There is so much to do after that. It is a big project. When I say trillions in funding, I\\'m serious. This is a very big thing, this is reinventing architecture when you are a caveman, going all the way up to the Renaissance, and building huge palaces. That is the scope of the project for us. I don\\'t think it will take as long as it took the cavemen, but I think that we\\'re definitely in for the long haul. To the extent that we can incrementally build meaningful rejuvenation therapies along the way, then many of us will also be in for the long haul, and this turns into someone\\'s life\\'s work. That life might be rather long. I don\\'t know how long people will live. I am in my late 40s, and if you can just run the thought experiment of the biotechnologies that will be available to me in my 80s, I won\\'t look anything like an 80 year old person today . I will have no chronic inflammation ; no senescent cells ; probably no cross-links in my body; my stem cells will have been replaced; my immune system gardened; and so on and so forth through a long list of treatments that are going to happen in the next few decades, and are very plausible right now. So you can add these things up and say, right, if an 80 year old has no inflammation, no senescent cells, no cross-links, no atherosclerosis , what does that do to health? Do you still look like an 80 year old? Can you go run a mile? No-one knows, and we get to find out by doing it. That is the great adventure. The big problems in aging are all comparatively simple to solve, and it is all benchwork in the lab to get your programs going. You don\\'t need the massive computational, big data, machine learning projects that are popular right now. The only place where present artificial intelligence might be useful is in improving the state of small molecule drug discovery, and my belief is that small molecule drug discovery will go away, largely, in favor of gene therapy . So maybe your AI is looking for genes or proteins that are of useful effect, but the present process of finding genes that have useful effects is not terrible. It is having good results. The upshot is, ok, where do you use AI in this process outside of small molecule development? And I don\\'t see anything in which AI is absolutely necessary, useful in any way other than incrementally improving the infrastructure, reducing costs. Targeting senescent cells with senolytics, that is where small molecules might be useful, but the best projects there don\\'t involve small molecules. Dealing with mitochondrial DNA damage ? No, that is benchwork, and it seems unlikely that small molecules can do anything meaningful there - that is gene therapy territory. Stem cells? Again, it is just a matter of developing the methodologies that can lead to successful therapies, and deep down under that development, you find a role for AI in anything where there is a lot of data to be analyzed, but it is only incremental improvement in cost and efficacy. Infrastructure makes the world turn, and incremental improvement is not to be sneezed at, but it is just a part of the technology background. You can\\'t just jump up and say \"we\\'re going to do AI for longevity\", no. You are going to do AI for biotechnology in general, and biotechnology is then applied to longevity. So AI will vanish into the tool space. It won\\'t be a major category that is up there on its own in the fight against aging. Right now it is because it is novel and because investors throw funding at AI like there\\'s no tomorrow, and entrepreneurs and scientists follow the funding. So you get In Silico Medicine , for example, and they are doing small molecule discovery AI, which is what most other people are now following on to do nowadays, because that is where the funding is in the present phase. But I think this will just fade into the background, it will be another tool in the toolkit. It isn\\'t exciting, it is not category changing. It is an incremental advance, using computers a little bit more to help you do things when there is a lot of data involved. Let\\'s talk about Effective Altruism . That community is doing smart things, in the sense that Big Philanthropy is thoroughly corrupt, and one should ask the question: if I want to do good in the world, versus conning myself into thinking that I did good in the world, what should I in fact do? You don\\'t give to the Red Cross, because the Red Cross is a thoroughly corrupt organization. The same for most large entities in philanthropy; they have enormous overheads, and most donated funding doesn\\'t go to the projects you would want it to go to. The Effective Altruism movement in that sense is great, and a very overdue examination and critique of philanthropy as a whole. Secondly, if the effective altruists can find convincing ways to convince high net worth individuals to actually give sensibly, this will be a good thing. I suspect that reason many of high net worth individuals don\\'t give sensibly is because they have absolutely no idea how to do good, and it is a big project to figure out how to do good at scale. If Effective Altruism can lead to more people in the high net worth category putting their funds into projects that actually have a good chance of improving the human condition, then that is a public good. The third strand is obviously that the Effective Altruism community includes people who are quite concerned about which projects to fund from a utilitarian point of view, and to the extent that anyone takes even a cursory look at aging, it is obviously the case that aging is far worse than anything else that happens anywhere. Pick your favorite cause in the third world, and I can tell you that those people are suffering more from aging than from the target of your favored cause. Even for war, even for famine, it is still the case that aging is much, much worse. This is a sad thing, because we could be dealing with all of these issues, but when it comes to prioritization, yes, if you want to solve famine because it is terrible and causes people to suffer, then you also be willing to work on solving aging in that same population, because it causes a far worse outcome to far more people. So the Effective Altruism community should logically work its way to advocacy for the treatment of aging as a medical condition, because it is undeniably the case that it is the worst problem facing humanity, and it is the most cost effective point of intervention to reduce suffering and death in the world. Even when intervening in tiny ways, the outcome is an enormous return on philanthropic investment in the cause. So I think that the effective altruists do good, and I think that there are not enough of them, and I think that they are not talking about aging to the degree that they should. But they are coming at it largely from an outsider perspective, and except for a few, they don\\'t understand the science, they don\\'t understand the degree to which rejuvenation is possible. Effective Altruism is a young movement, it has a way to go yet, but it has the potential to be very important. We shall see how it develops. In terms of our community engaging with effective altruists, it is all just advocacy at the end of the day. To the extent that the aging research and development community needs funding, then we set forth and engage the effective altruists to the extent that they have funds, or can influence sources of funding. If it is more effective to talk to effective altruists, then we aging advocates will do that, trust me. That might be challenging as an argument right now, as right now it is clearly more effective to talk to the venture capitalists, because they are very incentivized to put funding into these projects. Very large amounts of funding, in fact, to the point at which it would be very hard to raise that level of funding through any sort of philanthropic program. Unless of course you are talking to high net worth individuals. But convincing high net worth individuals to go and put funds into work on treating aging is Effective Altruism, whether or not you are cloaking it in that name. Certainly, I and others are guilty of poking high net worth individuals to say \"have you thought about this a little bit? Do you want to get old? You can do something about it. So go do something about it.\" But it is an incremental process. You can\\'t just flip a switch and have all of the trooping masses of the Effective Altruism community go off and spread the desired message. So we shall see. It will go where it goes. There is an enormous waste right now in development and deployment of ineffective ways to treat age-related disease, those that don\\'t target the causes of aging. Further it will cost a great deal to develop functional rejuvenation therapies that do target causes of aging. But if you look at the enormous amounts that are spent on merely coping with the consequences of aging , then making it go away is highly efficient. But of course it is not just about funding and cost, it is about effective reduction of suffering. Funding spent on anti-aging research is an enormously cost-effective way to reduce suffering, providing it is spent on the right anti-aging research, rather than the programs that are not likely to produce more than a small effect. So mTOR inhibitors are great compared to previous technologies for dealing with age-related diseases, because they influence a lot of processes, but the effect size is really not large in the grand scheme of things. If you are going to put funding into developing mTOR inhibitors, then fine, that is happening, then you should spend that same level of funding on aspects of the SENS program that can actually repair underlying damage, rather than trying to tweak the body to be a little more resilient to damage. People taking mTOR inhibitors are still going to die on the same schedule as the rest of us. That aren\\'t that much more resilient. People with senescent cells removed, on the other hand, well, who knows. We will see what that does to life span. I think that the pensions and insurance companies are going to be in for a rude awakening. Personally, I think that five years of additional life is not an unreasonable guess, and that will break a lot of insurance companies if they haven\\'t prepared successfully. Regarding what will convince the world that meaningful progress is happening and further meaningful progress is possible, I think that recent developments in the laboratory, particularly around senolytics, are convincing to scientists. That is helpful. But I don\\'t think that it convinces the world at large in a useful way. Things have to leave the lab for that to happen. The thing about senolytics is that even those initial compounds available now seem to be quite good at making a sizable impact on quality of life in older people, and possibly for autoimmune diseases , and a bunch of other things. To the degree that we can say \"guys, we\\'re giving you a rejuvenation pill, your arthritis is probably going to go away\" and then if even half of the patients lose their arthritis, or their symptoms are greatly minimized, and they lose their other inflammatory conditions, and we turn back early Alzheimer\\'s disease - and all of these are plausible things that senolytics should accomplish, based on the mouse studies - then if that happens, then suddenly rejuvenation therapies are a real thing, and people can stop saying it is impossible to rejuvenate humans. Then we can go from there to explain that this is just one part of a larger program. We\\'re just doing one tiny thing, and not even that well, and look how good it is. Senolytics will be the point at which an awful lot of things change. The early stages are happening right now. The self-experimentation community is doing interesting things with senolytics . Once the first studies that actually have large effects are published, it will be hard for regulators to keep these early senolytic drugs out of peoples\\' hands. There are 60 million people in the US alone who would benefit from senolytics because they are old enough to have conditions that are inflammatory. This should happen. It will happen. And that would be the moment, I think. Senolytics, not anything else. Aging is a huge burden. Effectively treating aging will solve many problems. Old people are old people because they are aged. If you rejuvenate them, then they are no longer old. They will have a better time of it, and if you have an aging population of 80 year olds who are physiologically like 65 year olds, then you have an aging population of 65 year olds, effectively. After that it is very easy.', 'publish_date': '2019-08-05', 'url': 'https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2019/08/an-interview-with-reason-at-undoing-aging-2019/', 'title': 'An Interview with Reason at Undoing Aging 2019'}, page_content='An Interview with Reason at Undoing Aging 2019'), Document(metadata={'start_index': 61, 'body': \"George Church is an important figure in the field of genetics, and in recent years has become more vocal in his support for rejuvenation research.

Over the past fifteen years, de Grey and his growing network of allies within and outside the scientific community have had an outsized influence on the culture of aging research, on public perception of the treatment of aging as a medical condition, and on meaningful progress towards therapies capable of rejuvenation. All of this has been achieved the old-fashioned way, ignored by mainstream funding institutions, and proceeding on the basis of a great deal of hard work and the pledges and philanthropic donations provided by a small, enthusiastic, and visionary community of supporters. At the turn of the century, the field of gerontology was run by senior researchers who actively suppressed public discussion and funding aimed at lengthening life or addressing the causes of aging. That was the product of decades of setting themselves up in opposition to the fraudulent \"anti-aging\" marketplace of pills and potions, but it was still the wrong thing to do - and it held back progress. At that time, despite the wealth of evidence to point the way to the molecular damage that causes aging , anyone talking seriously about treating aging was mocked. That was the environment facing the first members of the modern rejuvenation research community of patient advocates and a few brave researchers willing to risk their careers. In the years since then, we have collectively brought about a sea change, a great transformation in both research community and culture. Now, members of the scientific community enthusiastically discuss the treatment of aging, how to intervene in its progression, without fear of repercussion. A hundred times or more the investment in viable rejuvenation research programs is taking place, and venture investment in companies working on ways to address the medical condition of aging is well underway. The first rejuvenation therapies, those based on clearance of senescent cells , are under development in startup biotech companies, on their way to the clinic. None of this would have happened anywhere near as rapidly without the actions of those first individuals brave enough to champion an unpopular cause, to provide the first philanthropic funding for advocacy and research, to step up and make a difference, to swim against the current of the times. Ending Aging, with Aubrey de Grey Mark Sackler: You wrote the book Ending Aging in 2008. You identified seven areas of cellular and intracellular damage that you think need to be reversed as the best process for reversing aging. In the nine years since you wrote that book, what has changed? Are we where you thought we\\'d be by now? Have there been any breakthroughs? Aubrey de Grey: People often ask me, \"When are you going to write a new book - when are you going to update Ending Aging?\" It\\'s not a priority right now. It could easily be presumed to be saying that it\\'s not my priority simply because I haven\\'t made much progress and there\\'s not much to say. But it\\'s just the opposite of that - there\\'s been massive progress, but it\\'s been pretty much exactly the progress that we were predicting in the book. So essentially the plan is the same 7 points. There\\'s no problem number 8 or 9 that came along and had to be added. And furthermore, the solutions that we discussed in the book are still the same solutions. There\\'s nothing that has come along that has made us have to revisit it and say, well, OK, the approach that we thought was going to be the right way to go is actually much harder than we had expected and therefore we need something else\\xad\\xad - none of that has happened. There have been some surprises, but they have all been good surprises in the form of innovative technologies\\xad - new discoveries that have allowed us to pursue the same approaches but more effectively and more rapidly than we otherwise thought. Now there is one downside, though, which is, back then I started making predictions about the time frames of how long this will all take. And of course, I was always making a lot of caveats emphasizing that a prediction of time frames was very speculative for any pioneer in technology. However, the fact is we haven\\'t hit the time frames I was saying that we would. But what\\'s gone wrong is not the science, but something else. The answer is the money. The fact is that my predictions were always very strongly conditional on the ability to bring in funding that was sufficient so that the rate of progress would only be limited by the sheer difficulty of the technology, the actual science and practice. I believe we\\'ve been going along three times more slowly than that initial prediction simply because it\\'s been so much more difficult than I had expected to attract sufficient funding. Mark Sackler: What about using pharmaceuticals or supplements to slow the aging process - to buy more time before we reach SENS 1.0? There are several agents out there now. Metformin is about to go into human clinical trials , Rapamycin is in trials with dogs , and NAD+ supplements are all the rage right now. What\\'s your take on all of this? Aubrey de Grey: So I\\'m all for this work. I think that it\\'s very valuable in helping people to stay healthy longer. However, there is a very important feature of all of these supplements which is very often swept under the carpet by the researchers and companies that are working on them. They\\'re all hypothesized to work by calorie restriction memetics . In other words, drugs that trick the body into thinking it\\'s not getting as many calories as it would like, even though it is getting them. So that\\'s wonderful. Except that there\\'s a huge catch, and it has been a totally incontrovertible message in the animal data for decades. It is a fairly scandalous thing that has been swept under the carpet. The problem is that different species respond by different degrees to this kind of restriction. Specifically, long-lived species respond less than a short-lived species. The world record for how much you can extend the life of a nematode worm that normally lives about three weeks is by a factor of five. But then if you go up and look at organisms that live a couple of years, like mice, you can only get a factor of one and a half. That\\'s still very impressive but it\\'s definitely not five. But unfortunately, this trend persists as you go higher up the chain. For example, about 20 years ago you\\'re in a very thorough and rigorous trial made with Labrador dogs , which normally live about 11 years, and on the whole, it resulted in only about a 10% increase in lifespan. And over the past 20 odd years, two groups in the US have performed extraordinarily expensive and time-consuming experiments of calorie restriction on monkeys , and depending on how you interpret that, it yielded maybe a couple of percent increase. So, the prognosis for humans is not terribly good. Now again I want to emphasize I\\'m fine with the fact that people are excited by these drugs, because they do seem to keep people healthy; they are protective, but it is critical not to make the extrapolation that they are the foundation to extending life - because in no way has that happened. Mark Sackler: One of the hottest biotech topics lately has been genetic editing , and there have been at least two individuals who recently had genetic editing therapy performed on themselves . I wonder what you make of those efforts. Aubrey de Grey: Well, first let me talk about gene targeting in general. CRISPR is a fantastic breakthrough. When I was talking at the beginning about the surprises that we\\'d had, that\\'s probably the single biggest one - because the fact is that before it came along, there was very little that we could do to change genes. We had methods for gene targeting, for modifying the genome, but they were very laborious and expensive. Now as for self-experimentation one can look at it in a whole bunch of ways. First, one can be curmudgeonly about it and say, well okay, this is very unsafe. God knows what\\'s going to happen if bad things happen if these people die as a result of that therapy; it is going to set back the whole field to a large degree. That\\'s all true up to a point. But at the same time, we have to remember that self-experimentation is not new. It has a long and very distinguished history in biology. JBS Haldane , the distinguished and respected British biologist from the 1930s, was rather famous for doing things to himself that I certainly wouldn\\'t dare to. Certainly, the scientific information that will come from this sort of experimentation effort is probably very limited, simply by the fact that it is a sample size of 1. But on the other hand, the high-profile news that arises and the fact that people are talking about what is happening and a discussion is actually occurring, has its own value. If people are not interested in something, it\\'s very hard to get them to think about it, whereas if they are interested, even for an unusual and rather tangential reason, you can educate them. Mark Sackler: Earlier this year I interviewed David Wood on his book The Abolition of Aging . In it he forecast that by 2040 there is a 50-50 chance of there being widely available affordable rejuvenation therapy. How do you feel about that forecast right now? Is it overly optimistic? Is it well within reach if there\\'s enough money, or is it totally uncertain? Aubrey de Grey: It\\'s pretty much exactly the same as my prediction. That may not be a coincidence.', 'publish_date': '2018-01-18', 'url': 'https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2018/01/aubrey-de-grey-on-ending-aging-and-the-relative-merits-of-various-approaches/', 'start_index': 2473}, page_content='brave enough to champion an unpopular cause, to provide the first philanthropic funding for advocacy and research, to step up and make a difference, to swim against the current of the times.

If you don't have a background in the life sciences, but nonetheless find human longevity a compelling topic, and would like to work in the field, what can you do? That is a good question, and often asked. There are many options that don't involve working as a scientist in a laboratory, though educating yourself about the science helps a great deal when it comes to picking the better options from the array of choices on the table. Aging is a set of molecular and cellular processes that affects us all, but what if we could extend our healthy lifespan and live longer, healthier lives? This is the goal of the rapidly growing field of longevity. And after my last post about leaving my CTO job to work on longevity a lot of people have reached out asking what I'm working on actually? What I'm building for longevity? The short answer is... nothing. Yet. The long answer is... well, this post. I believe that anyone can work on anything they put their mind to if they are willing to put in the time and effort to learn the necessary skills. Whether it's research, funding, talent, media, practical longevity, aging therapeutics, or infrastructure, there are numerous opportunities to make a significant impact in this field. $6.96 billion was raised across 96 funding rounds in 2022. This may seem like a lot but it's actually nothing. Remember that Instagram was acquired for $1 billion. So trying to bring more funding to the longevity field is very much needed. Someone needs to help talented people transition into the field. And believe me, we need far, far more people working on longevity. Recruiting and community building are important. The narrative around longevity is changing towards a more strategic conservatism which is proving to have better adoption. But it's far away from reaching a mainstream level. We need more communicators designing and evolving new narratives for different people. The first drug targeted to extend healthy lifespan by 10-20 years could be developed and commercialized this decade. Aging therapeutics usually means getting the science out of the lab. So most often than not, someone with biology background will try to start or join a startup around their expertise. But what about people who are not coming from academia? The reality is that it may take anything from 6 months to 1 year (maybe even more) of full dedication to gain enough context, map the gaps, understand low hanging fruits, understand which technologies are the most promising, and get in love with a strong hypothesis to join or build a startup around it. This is the hardest part: in an ocean of possibilities, which one to choose? Which one is the most interesting? What technology is the most promising? What are the low hanging fruits?

This is a good example of the general approach to aging taken by the research community: start at the end stage manifestation of dysfunction, such as menopause, and work backwards through layers of metabolic changes in search of causes. These changes are reactions to cellular and molecular damage that is fairly well described at this time. Researchers have a good catalog of the fundamental differences between old tissues and young tissues, but for most outcomes in aging there is no good understanding in detail of exactly how this damage spirals out to produce the observed late stage results. So how to go about filling this gap in understanding? Instead of trying to fix the damage and working forwards to see the results, researchers follow a strategy of working backwards from the end stages. The final state of knowledge will be the same, but this approach is far less likely to produce meaningful treatments: applications of partial knowledge of the late stages of disease leads to efforts to manipulate the operation of a complex system in order that it runs less poorly when damaged . It is patching a failing machine, hard, expensive and doomed to failure. Compare that with treatments that remove the damage: much simpler, and more likely to be effective. If your engine rusts, you remove the rust every now and again, not rebuild the engine to work slightly better while rusting into uselessness. Some women can have successful pregnancies at the age of 50, whereas other are unable to get pregnant when they are 30. Researchers are not yet able to fully explain such differences. One factor is that the onset of menopause is influenced by the point at which the uterus runs out of eggs to release. A recent [study] sheds light on the mystery of the biological clock that governs fertility. Just as newborn infants require nurturance in order to survive, eggs in the uterus need nourishment and support from the granulosa cells of the primary follicle. According to the latest [discovery] a signaling pathway in these cells plays a key role in enabling immature eggs to survive. The mTOR signaling pathway in the granulosa cells is necessary for activating expression of the kit ligand growth factor , which subsequently binds to the c-kit receptors of eggs and determines their fate. \"This mechanism permits the granulosa cells to decide when eggs will begin to grow and when they will die. In that sense, they serve as a kind of biological clock that monitors the onset of menopause.\" Researchers believe that the discovery will point the way to interventions that stimulate the growth of eggs that have been unable to mature.

This makes them reluctant to believe\\r\\nthat reversing aging in mice is foreseeable, since it can\\'t \"even\" be done in\\r\\nthese simpler organisms.  That means they don\\'t support grant applications\\r\\nto try to develop reversal of aging, and that means such work doesn\\'t get\\r\\ndone.  This is one of my more recent attempts to change that. The following is a slightly (only slightly, I\\'m afraid) tidied-up\\r\\nversion of something I wrote a few days ago to Tom Johnson, a very\\r\\nprominent and well-known biogerontologist who discovered the first\\r\\nlife-extending mutation in any animal, the nematode mutation age-1 .\\r\\nThat was about 15 years ago, and Tom had an extremely hard time getting\\r\\nhis colleagues to believe his result, even though he was as thoroughly\\r\\ntrained as any geneticist and had obtained very solid data.  He hasn\\'t\\r\\nforgotten this, so his attitude to my rather analogous current battle\\r\\nto get biogerontology to take seriously the idea of reversing aging is one of sympathy and support, even though he is very skeptical\\r\\nof the possibility of such a thing.  Because of this he has initiated\\r\\na dialogue with me to give me a chance to convince him of my view.  I\\r\\nhave found this dialogue very useful in sharpening up my reasoning for\\r\\nwhy reversing aging is not only possible but foreseeable. By way of background, readers should first familiarise themselves (if\\r\\nthey don\\'t know about it already) with the outline of my proposal for\\r\\nreversing mammalian (eventually human) aging.  I have a website about\\r\\nmy work here , and the seven\\r\\nkey components of my approach are summarised here , with links\\r\\nto more detailed descriptions.  In my letter to Tom, I seek to clarify\\r\\nexactly why it is appropriate to call these approaches \"aging-reversal\"\\r\\ninterventions.  The conclusion of my reasoning is that reversing aging\\r\\nin flies or worms is actually really hard, a lot harder than in mice,\\r\\nlargely because (to cut a long story short) flies and worms aren\\'t\\r\\namenable to stem cell therapy.  Its not just stem cell therapy, either:\\r\\nthere are a few other fundamental components of aging that are probably\\r\\nno easier (though no harder either) to reverse in these so-called\\r\\n\"simple\" animals than in mammals.  This is an extremely surprising\\r\\nconclusion to any mainstream gerontologist, accustomed to thinking of\\r\\nsmall invertebrates as much simpler than a mammal and thus much easier\\r\\nto manipulate -- and, indeed, on the face of it the achievements of\\r\\ngerontology so far are in opposition to my view, since worm lifespan\\r\\nhas been increased by a factor of six and mouse lifespan only by much\\r\\nless than a factor of two.  I don\\'t yet know what Tom thinks of my\\r\\nargument, but I will report his reply here in due course. The importance of all this to non-scientists is that people like Tom\\r\\nhold the key to the rate of progress in curing aging.  While senior\\r\\nbiogerontologists think reversing aging is impossible, however wrong\\r\\ntheir reasons for thinking that, they will not support the spending\\r\\nof significant sums on trying to do it.  And because nearly all money\\r\\nfor research is targeted by a system of expert peer review, the lack\\r\\nof their support is decisive. Tom asked in his latest communication whether there was any evidence\\r\\nfor a treatment in any species making that individual or population of\\r\\nindividuals 20% younger.  He said that this is the sort of definitive\\r\\ncriterion that it would take to convince a skeptical public.  Here\\'s\\r\\nmy reply. -------------- Hi Tom, I agree absolutely.  Here is a clear-cut statement of my position: 1) Health being so hard to measure, the only persuasive measure of\\r\\n   \"physiological age\" that is available to us today is remaining life\\r\\n   expectancy in the absence of any (hypothetical) future anti-aging\\r\\n   technologies. 2) Thus, an intervention can only properly be described as an \"aging\\r\\n   reversal\" therapy if its one-off delivery to an organism a fair\\r\\n   way through its natural life expectancy considerably increases\\r\\n   its remaining life expectancy. 3) Even a therapy that meets this criterion can be argued not quite\\r\\n   to be an aging-reversal therapy but instead a really good aging\\r\\n   retardation therapy.  Certainly if the remaining lifespan following\\r\\n   the therapy is longer than the total lifespan without the therapy,\\r\\n   we must clearly conclude that retardation has occurred (though\\r\\n   reversal may have occurred too). 4) On the other hand, the idea that the therapy must be one-off,\\r\\n   rather than periodic or continuous, is perhaps over-restrictive:\\r\\n   a modest aging-reversal therapy applied once might give results\\r\\n   than fell short of statistical significance, whereas repeated\\r\\n   therapy would do better. 5) Hence, what I mean by an aging-reversal therapy is one that (a)\\r\\n   substantially increases remaining life expectancy when applied\\r\\n   late-onset, whether once or often, and (b) causes a reduction of\\r\\n   some set of quantifiable parameters that increase progressively\\r\\n   throughout aging and that we have some reason to believe make a\\r\\n   contribution to pathology once they reach sufficient abundance.

So, that means that I agree 100% with the mainstream biogerontology\\r\\nconsensus that we do not yet have an aging-reversal intervention (by\\r\\nthe above definition) in any animal.

The following is a slightly (only slightly, I\\'m afraid) tidied-up\\r\\nversion of something I wrote a few days ago to Tom Johnson, a very\\r\\nprominent and well-known biogerontologist who discovered the first\\r\\nlife-extending mutation in any animal, the nematode mutation age-1 .\\r\\nThat was about 15 years ago, and Tom had an extremely hard time getting\\r\\nhis colleagues to believe his result, even though he was as thoroughly\\r\\ntrained as any geneticist and had obtained very solid data.

I have a website about\\r\\nmy work here , and the seven\\r\\nkey components of my approach are summarised here , with links\\r\\nto more detailed descriptions.  In my letter to Tom, I seek to clarify\\r\\nexactly why it is appropriate to call these approaches \"aging-reversal\"\\r\\ninterventions.  The conclusion of my reasoning is that reversing aging\\r\\nin flies or worms is actually really hard, a lot harder than in mice,\\r\\nlargely because (to cut a long story short) flies and worms aren\\'t\\r\\namenable to stem cell therapy.  Its not just stem cell therapy, either:\\r\\nthere are a few other fundamental components of aging that are probably\\r\\nno easier (though no harder either) to reverse in these so-called\\r\\n\"simple\" animals than in mammals.  This is an extremely surprising\\r\\nconclusion to any mainstream gerontologist, accustomed to thinking of\\r\\nsmall invertebrates as much simpler than a mammal and thus much easier\\r\\nto manipulate -- and, indeed, on the face of it the achievements of\\r\\ngerontology so far are in opposition to my view, since worm lifespan\\r\\nhas been increased by a factor of six and mouse lifespan only by much\\r\\nless than a factor of two.  I don\\'t yet know what Tom thinks of my\\r\\nargument, but I will report his reply here in due course. The importance of all this to non-scientists is that people like Tom\\r\\nhold the key to the rate of progress in curing aging.  While senior\\r\\nbiogerontologists think reversing aging is impossible, however wrong\\r\\ntheir reasons for thinking that, they will not support the spending\\r\\nof significant sums on trying to do it.  And because nearly all money\\r\\nfor research is targeted by a system of expert peer review, the lack\\r\\nof their support is decisive. Tom asked in his latest communication whether there was any evidence\\r\\nfor a treatment in any species making that individual or population of\\r\\nindividuals 20% younger.  He said that this is the sort of definitive\\r\\ncriterion that it would take to convince a skeptical public.  Here\\'s\\r\\nmy reply. -------------- Hi Tom, I agree absolutely.  Here is a clear-cut statement of my position: 1) Health being so hard to measure, the only persuasive measure of\\r\\n   \"physiological age\" that is available to us today is remaining life\\r\\n   expectancy in the absence of any (hypothetical) future anti-aging\\r\\n   technologies. 2) Thus, an intervention can only properly be described as an \"aging\\r\\n   reversal\" therapy if its one-off delivery to an organism a fair\\r\\n   way through its natural life expectancy considerably increases\\r\\n   its remaining life expectancy. 3) Even a therapy that meets this criterion can be argued not quite\\r\\n   to be an aging-reversal therapy but instead a really good aging\\r\\n   retardation therapy.  Certainly if the remaining lifespan following\\r\\n   the therapy is longer than the total lifespan without the therapy,\\r\\n   we must clearly conclude that retardation has occurred (though\\r\\n   reversal may have occurred too). 4) On the other hand, the idea that the therapy must be one-off,\\r\\n   rather than periodic or continuous, is perhaps over-restrictive:\\r\\n   a modest aging-reversal therapy applied once might give results\\r\\n   than fell short of statistical significance, whereas repeated\\r\\n   therapy would do better. 5) Hence, what I mean by an aging-reversal therapy is one that (a)\\r\\n   substantially increases remaining life expectancy when applied\\r\\n   late-onset, whether once or often, and (b) causes a reduction of\\r\\n   some set of quantifiable parameters that increase progressively\\r\\n   throughout aging and that we have some reason to believe make a\\r\\n   contribution to pathology once they reach sufficient abundance. This is the central message of my work over the past few years.  I\\r\\nclaim that there are only seven major classes of parameter fitting\\r\\nthe above description that are not already known to be entirely the\\r\\nresult of the changes in other such parameters (though in many cases\\r\\nthe pecking order of which parameters affect which others the most\\r\\nis of course not known).

You might recall that their past positions on this topic have been almost comically terrible , omitting any mention of ongoing efforts to treat aging as a medical condition, either slowing it down or SENS-like approaches to repair the causes of aging. Their policy was stuck in the era of aging as an inevitable fact of like, written in stone and to be suffered rather than addressed. Insofar as the WHO sets standards for medicine, such as via the Classification of Diseases , and influences the positions taken by government bodies, those in the research community who depend upon public funding have an incentive to try to shift the bounds of the system. That said, producing large degrees of change from within any large institution, playing by their rules in order to change those rules, is a long, painful, and expensive process in comparison to the efforts needed to become a successful revolutionary working outside the system, making the system irrelevant - which is why I\\'ve never favored the former of the two options. That is my opinion, and obviously others feel differently. For those wishing to help create change in the WHO, the Life Extension Advocacy Foundation (LEAF) volunteers have put together an article outlining how best to offer commentary : Very recently, the World Health Organization, which is essentially the United Nations\\' agency for coordinating international health-related efforts, has launched The Global Online Consultation on Research Priority Setting for Healthy Aging. A corresponding survey is available on the WHO website and can be filled until September 30. As the WHO is the main source of policy recommendations for the UN member states, its position can significantly influence the allocation of state funding to different areas of scientific research. This is why we at LEAF urge you to step in and fill out the WHO survey; our community needs to demand more focused efforts to understand the basic mechanisms of aging, to develop innovative therapies to address these mechanisms, and to remove the barriers delaying the implementation of rejuvenation technologies into clinical practice. While UN and WHO strategic documents, such as the world report on ageing and health (2015) , the global strategy and action plan on ageing and health (2016) and the new set of Sustainable Development Goals include some provisions to encourage scientific research and development of new medicines, studies on biological aging and development of rejuvenation biotechnologies have never been made one of the main priorities. Furthermore, the application of medical technologies able to slow down, postpone and reverse the main mechanisms of aging has not been considered a viable approach to cope with the growing morbidity of age-related diseases provoked by rapid population aging. Instead, the main measures suggested to prepare our society to these demographic changes are to stimulate the birthrate while adapting healthcare systems and transforming living environments to become more age-friendly. Even though studies on aging have a long history, there have been very recent breakthroughs, such as senolytics , Yamanaka factors , and gene therapies to extend telomeres . Due to remarkable progress in taming several hallmarks of aging , we might see the first powerful rejuvenation therapies enter the market in the next five years. The more prepared our society will be to support their development and implementation, the better. The most efficient way to accomplish this is to make an opinion leader like WHO accumulate the corresponding data faster and to form an official position that will be delivered right to the heads of the ministries of health and science around the globe. We encourage every member of our community to fill out the form - you don\\'t need a background in science for your response to be taken seriously. This is an open consultation, a disseminated \"think tank\" to provide the working group at WHO with a spectrum of ideas. If our opinion is represented in a significant share of surveys, we shall see it appear in the resulting WHO recommendations.

      "QUESTION:\n",
      "What advice could you give to a new researcher in the field of age-reversal? What are the key and most important concepts. Be very descriptive. Make sure to mention the most critical subjects.\n",
      "\n",
      "ANSWER:\n",
      "\n",
      "---------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "--- ⬅️  Final Answer ---\n",
      "Based on the provided context from FightAging.org, here is descriptive advice for a new researcher in the field of age-reversal, highlighting the most critical concepts and subjects.\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Adopt a Damage-Repair (SENS) Philosophy:**\n",
      "The most critical strategic concept is to focus on **repairing the root causes of aging** rather than just slowing it down or investigating it without the goal of intervention. The SENS (Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence) research framework is the archetype for this approach. Aging is viewed as the accumulation of a limited number of types of molecular and cellular damage. The goal of rejuvenation biotechnology is to periodically repair this damage, restoring the body to a more youthful state. This is considered a more viable and powerful path to extending healthy human lifespan than strategies aimed at merely slowing the aging process.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Understand the Seven Categories of Aging Damage:**\n",
      "Your research should be directed at one of the seven major classes of age-related damage, as identified by the SENS paradigm. These are the key subjects for any researcher aiming to reverse aging:\n",
      "*   **Cell loss/atrophy:** Addressed by replenishing cells via stem cell therapies or stimulating cell division.\n",
      "*   **Nuclear mutations/epigenomic alterations:** Focused on the prevention of cancer, for example, by removing genes for telomere-lengthening.\n",
      "*   **Mitochondrial mutations:** Developing methods to make mitochondrial DNA damage harmless, such as by allotopically expressing mitochondrial genes from the nucleus.\n",
      "*   **Death-resistant cells:** The clearance of senescent cells (senolytics) is a leading and advanced area of research.\n",
      "*   **Extracellular matrix stiffening:** Breaking down harmful cross-links in tissues, such as glucosepane.\n",
      "*   **Extracellular aggregates:** Clearing out amyloid and other types of junk that accumulate outside cells.\n",
      "*   **Intracellular aggregates:** Removing waste products that build up inside cells, such as lipofuscin.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Prioritize Engineering over Pure Investigation:**\n",
      "Adopt a goal-oriented, engineering mindset. You do not need a complete understanding of the entire, complex chain of cause and effect in aging to begin fixing it. The philosophy is to \"engineer your way through uncertainty\" by developing therapies that reverse the known, fundamental changes between old and young tissue. This approach is more likely to produce meaningful rejuvenation therapies than the traditional method of working backwards from the complex, late-stage diseases of aging.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Be Persistent and Prepared for Obstacles:**\n",
      "The context emphasizes that aging research is a field with a history of skepticism and funding difficulties. You must be prepared for:\n",
      "*   **Funding Challenges:** A significant amount of a researcher's time may be consumed by securing funding, as only a small fraction of promising projects are financed.\n",
      "*   **Scientific Resistance:** Be prepared to challenge conventional wisdom and face skepticism, especially from those who believe aging is immutable or should only be investigated, not treated.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Keep Sight of the Big Picture:**\n",
      "While it is easy to become overwhelmed by details, always remember the ultimate humanitarian goal: to alleviate the immense suffering and death caused by age-related disease. This sense of purpose will help you persist through periods of frustration and failure. Avoid becoming a \"hostage\" to a single theory; maintain a data-driven approach and a critical, open mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the most critical advice is to align your work with the **SENS framework of damage repair**, focus your research on one of the **seven key categories of aging damage**, and maintain an **engineering-focused, goal-oriented mindset** to develop actual rejuvenation therapies, all while being persistent in the face of the field's unique challenges.\n"
