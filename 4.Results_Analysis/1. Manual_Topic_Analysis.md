# Part 1: Topic Analysis of FightAging.org using Classic NLP Methods

## Introduction

This section uses classic **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to map primary themes and their evolution within FightAging.org content. Examining word and phrase frequencies establishes a foundational, human-interpretable understanding of key topics from 2004 to 2025, revealing an arc from foundational concepts to research frontiers.

## Methodology

The analysis used 18,753 articles. Text from the title and body of each article was combined and preprocessed:
1.  Converted text to **lowercase**.
2.  **Removed punctuation** and numerical characters.
3.  **Tokenized** text into words.
4.  **Filtered out** common English stopwords and custom domain-specific words (e.g., "aging," "research") to reduce noise.

Primary techniques were **word frequency analysis** (visualized as a word cloud) and **bigram** (two-word phrase) analysis.

## Key Findings: Overall Themes

Analysis of the 20-year period highlights core discussion pillars. The most frequent bigrams clarify central topics:

* **Dominant Concepts**: **"Stem cells"** and **"senescent cells"** are the primary biological targets and therapeutic avenues.
* **Key Interventions**: **"Calorie restriction"** is the most frequently mentioned lifestyle intervention.
* **Disease Focus**: **"Alzheimer's disease"** is the most discussed age-related disease, followed by cancer and cardiovascular disease.
* **Biological Mechanisms**: Frequent mentions of **"cellular senescence," "chronic inflammation," "oxidative stress,"** and **"DNA damage"** show a focus on underlying mechanisms.

The word cloud visually confirms these findings, with **senescent**, **cell**, **treatment**, **disease**, **human**, and **alzheimers** as central terms.

## Thematic Evolution Over Time

Dividing content into three eras—Initial (2004-2010), Middle (2011-2017), and Recent (2018-2025)—shows the field's evolving focus.

### 1. Initial Era (2004-2010): Foundational Years

This period focused on broad concepts and key figures.
* **Top Topics**: Discussions were dominated by **"stem cells"** and **"calorie restriction."**
* **Key Influencers**: High frequency of **"Aubrey de Grey"** and **"Methuselah Foundation"** points to a focus on the philosophical and organizational origins of the movement.

### 2. Middle Era (2011-2017): Rise of Senolytics

This era shifted toward a more specific, mechanistic understanding.
* **Emergence of a New Pillar**: **"Senescent cells"** rose dramatically in prominence, signaling excitement around targeting them (**senolytics**). **"Stem cells"** remained a top subject.
* **Increased Disease Focus**: Mentions of **"Alzheimer's disease"** became more frequent.

### 3. Recent Era (2018-2025): Clinical & Mechanistic Focus

The most recent period shows field maturation, focusing on translation and complex systems.
* **Senolytics Take the Lead**: **"Senescent cells"** surpassed "stem cells" as the most discussed topic.
* **Spotlight on Alzheimer's**: **"Alzheimer's disease"** is the second most frequent topic.
* **Towards Application**: The appearance of **"clinical trials"** signifies a shift from preclinical research to human application.
* **New Frontiers**: Topics like the **"gut microbiome"** indicate a broadening of research into new systems.

## Conclusion for Part 1

This analysis illustrates the trajectory of the longevity field chronicled by FightAging.org. The progression moves from foundational ideas and key influencers to a focus on a central mechanism (**cellular senescence**), and finally toward a mature stage emphasizing the treatment of specific diseases and the translation of research into clinical applications.
