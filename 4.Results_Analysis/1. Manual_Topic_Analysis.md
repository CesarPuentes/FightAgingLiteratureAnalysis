# Part 1: Topic Analysis of FightAging.org using Classic NLP Methods

## Introduction

This first section of the analysis uses classic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to map the primary themes and their evolution within the content of FightAging.org. By examining word and phrase frequencies, we can establish a foundational, human-interpretable understanding of the key topics discussed on the site from 2004 to 2025. This analysis reveals a clear narrative arc, from foundational concepts to the latest research frontiers, providing a baseline for the more advanced analyses in subsequent sections.

## Methodology

The analysis was performed on a dataset of 18,753 articles. The text from the title and body of each article was combined and preprocessed to create a clean corpus for analysis. This process involved:
1.  Converting all text to lowercase.
2.  Removing punctuation and numerical characters.
3.  Tokenizing the text into individual words.
4.  Filtering out common English stopwords and a custom list of domain-specific words (e.g., "aging", "research", "study") to reduce noise and highlight meaningful terms.

The primary analytical techniques were word frequency analysis, visualized as a word cloud, and bigram (two-word phrase) analysis to identify key concepts and their relationships.

## Key Findings: Overall Themes

An analysis of the entire 20-year period highlights the core **themes** of discussion on FightAging.org. The most frequent bigrams reveal the central topics with remarkable clarity.



* **Dominant Concepts**: The most prominent topics are **"stem cells"** and **"senescent cells."** These two concepts represent the primary biological targets and therapeutic avenues discussed on the site.
* **Key Interventions**: **"Calorie restriction"** stands out as the most frequently mentioned lifestyle intervention, underscoring its foundational role in aging research.
* **Disease Focus**: There is a strong emphasis on specific age-related diseases, with **"Alzheimer's disease"** being the most discussed, followed by cancer and cardiovascular disease.
* **Biological Mechanisms**: The content delves deep into the underlying mechanisms of aging, with frequent mentions of **"cellular senescence," "chronic inflammation," "oxidative stress,"** and **"DNA damage."**

The word cloud visually confirms these findings, with **senescent**, **cell**, **treatment**, **disease**, **human**, and **alzheimers** being among the largest and most central terms, providing an at-a-glance summary of the blog's focus.

## Thematic Evolution Over Time

Dividing the content into three distinct eras—Initial (2004-2010), Middle (2011-2017), and Recent (2018-2025)—reveals a compelling narrative about the evolution of focus in the longevity field.



### 1. Initial Era (2004-2010): The Foundational Years

This period focused on broad, foundational concepts and the key figures driving the nascent longevity movement.
* **Top Topics**: Discussions were heavily dominated by **"stem cells"** and **"calorie restriction."**
* **Key Influencers**: The high frequency of **"Aubrey de Grey"** and **"Methuselah Foundation"** points to a focus on the philosophical and organizational origins of the modern anti-aging movement.

### 2. Middle Era (2011-2017): The Rise of Senolytics

This era marks a significant shift towards a more specific, mechanistic understanding of aging.
* **Emergence of a New Cornerstone**: While **"stem cells"** remained a top subject, **"senescent cells"** rose dramatically in prominence, signaling the scientific community's growing excitement around targeting senescent cells (senolytics).
* **Increased Disease Focus**: Mentions of **"Alzheimer's disease"** became more frequent.

### 3. Recent Era (2018-2025): The Clinical & Mechanistic Focus

The most recent period shows a maturation of the field, with a clear focus on translation and complex systems.
* **Senolytics Take the Lead**: **"Senescent cells"** surpassed "stem cells" as the single most discussed topic, reflecting its central role in current research.
* **Spotlight on Alzheimer's**: **"Alzheimer's disease"** is now the second most frequent topic, highlighting it as a critical target for interventions.
* **Towards Application**: The appearance of **"clinical trials"** signifies a major shift from preclinical research to human application.
* **New Frontiers**: The emergence of topics like the **"gut microbiome"** indicates a broadening of research into new systems that influence aging.

## Conclusion for Part 1

This manual analysis effectively illustrates the trajectory of the longevity field as chronicled by FightAging.org. The progression is logical: from foundational ideas and key influencers to a deep focus on a central mechanism (cellular senescence), and finally toward a mature stage emphasizing the treatment of specific diseases and the translation of research into clinical applications. These findings provide a clear and robust baseline that sets the stage for the automated topic modeling techniques explored in the next section.
